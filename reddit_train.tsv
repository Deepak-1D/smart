Grow a beard.  It's our birthright as men.	Yawn
I have a sudden desire to jump through a flaming table and I'm not sure why	LeSean McAllTheWayToMpls
Yes. Give your QB the best running prospect in years, and the best player in the draft. Minkah is fine, but Barkley is as elite as they come, and a can't miss prospect this team desperately needs	I'd say their talent levels are very similar at their respective positions, but usually when it's close between a running back and a FS you take the guy who's almost certainly going to have a longer career in Minkah
There is a NYRR Midnight Run that starts at midnight in Central Park, so there should be some music things and definitely fireworks, it is a fun atmosphere and not a crowded mess like Times Sqaure. If you can brave the cold then have at it!	Good to know, thanks! We've been braving the colds for the last few days so one more night should be do-able.
I'm drinking a Brut Rose of some sort after having chased my husband's friends for the majority of the day.  He's asleep in his chair next to me and considering that we've been contemplating splitting, I'll take it. He threatened me with divorce and the next day I made a list of how we would separate assets, etc and it shocked his system that I would take him seriously.  I'm fairly lubricated and probably not making a ton of sense but the short of it is. . . we will make it.  It's been 20 years, we're both fighters, and well. . .Happy 2018!  New Year, New outlook!	Good luck! I really wish you all the best. Marriage is hard, man. But worth it. 
Glossy neck?	Yea :/ Tempted to sand it down a bit, but it's not the worst.
Why does he need a wildcard? Isn't he ranked in the top 20?	No, he dropped all the way down to 46 in the world... It's ridiculous how he started 2017 in top 10 and finished the year 40 places below. 
We're here in 2018 while OP is over in 14471.	I didn't know Earth had that many time zones. 
Social democracy is the left wing of fascism.	Lol this is one of the most hilarious tankie soundbites, utterly baffling. 
Love this show 	I have been watching this show religiously since it came out. I fall asleep to it just about every night.
Any breweries open today?	Yeah I have the same question. Wonder when New Realm actually opens. 
Go to the site: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_D2dx6gG2mYKuSAqtkMFqg is TRNSPRTR or Ttransporter one of the 200 Galactick BRR he runs this season 12 on a 918 Maxed and learns ...	Where do you find the reruns ? Do I have to own the car to rerun ? Thanks :)
How do you record the screen on the watch?	I'd say it's a screen recording from the phone... :-)
I have this feeling that this is not gonna go well for SRK.😂	Ahhh, I really hope you're wrong! We need more original ideas like this, FAN, etc. in Bollywood!
I am working on the Stark one right now! The patterns are from Etsy. Was supposed to be a Christmas present for my husband. Your Gf obviously has better time management skills than me! 	I too greatly underestimated the duration of time it would take to complete a 10" x 10" needlepoint Chewbacca pillow for my brother's Christmas gift. As of Sunday, I think I'm halfway done. Best of luck to you!
Did you guys see Maddox's salty-ass video about Arby's marketing taking advantage of gamers or whatever? No fun allowed	Yeah, using humor to entice people to your business for a largely arbitrary decision is the worst kind of exploitation.
Thinking of setting up a NAS soon. Should I grab this or should I get an HDD designed for that purpose, like an Ironwolf or WD Red?	Depends on how often you are writing to the disk and how important your data is.
Thank you so much!! I’m totally going to use this if thats cool with you. 	Go ahead my dude
How did you clean the tar off?	Used an old wood planer, and going 1/32 at a time we took layers of wood &amp; tar off.  Repeated the process 4 or 5 times to get most of the tar off.
I'm using Open Build Service in order to maintain the transparency, building from source directly. Feel free to test it: https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/309 Note: Please provide the feedback on the GitHub issue. Thanks.	Is the vm killing the hashrate? Seems low for an i7.
Wait .What are the ones left of holly?	Emerald and Hessonite
I'm not sure I want the glaciers back.  I've never been the nomadic type walking around in furs. 	just come to the midwest right now for a sneak peek
If she has otherwise been a good employee cut her hours per her request and demote her.  If things don't work out, then terminate her.  Don't terminate employment based on what you think might possibly under the right conditions happen, terminate based on real actions.	This x1000. Don't cause problems where there are none yet.
Just 6 points halfway through the quarter? Where have I heard that before?	Hey that's like three times as many as the Toronto game!
Electrum Sabercraft has a lightsaber that connects to your phone via Bluetooth! You should check them out.	I chatted with them a minute and they recommended a DIY Arduino project. I think gutting an echo dot and a custom board could work though.
You consider letting a set come to complete silence &gt;5 times putting 2000% into each transition....?	Those are some of my favorite parts. When the sound slowly fades and it's replaced with people cheering. 
Just looking at Violets heels make my feet hurt 	They're Louboutins, the pain is worth it.
I’m a personal trainer.... boardgaming came naturally since when I was 10 I had a Spectrum and videogames grown with me till today ;)	Favorite game from it??
that's actually somewhat realistic, besides that she's talking to herself 	I did try a playthrough where I named all my pawns "Dave Dave" for fore and surnames. It got very confusing very quickly.
at least 3. Maybe even 4 	We have a winner
Read up on Mustique. It would be a serious coup. But I suspect totally outside the realm of what the folks at freesociety.org are targeting. This is the playground of those who call themselves royalty.	what do you mean serious coup?
lolololloooolllolololol. Please, though, seriously Bandai. No more OP BRV units. Give Madara to BOD / SKL / WIS please.	WIS is pretty lacking in good healers in my experience. There's Karin but I don't even know who else. 
Druids have a spell that lets them create a woodland haven for 24 hrs. It’s 5th lvl. If it is casted every day for a year it becomes permanent. Maybe consider doing the same. If he casts it once a day for a year it becomes permanent 	That's generally how spells that v an become permanent work in 5e, so I'd agree with this idea. Conversely, the ship could be created as a magic item (probably Very Rare or Legendary), with appropriate time and money costs.
If they're not clear that they're a prozzie then you don't have to pay.  This story sounds like a normal human interaction except for her saying yes.	You can report them to the Better Business Bureau for misadvertisement.
timbre is a good app that covers many	awesome I'll check it out.
It was a game that happened.	It wasn't the worst game we've seen from Spurs 
Those look fantastic, enjoy your games!	Thanks! I can't wait. Played a small 100pt game a few weeks back with a borrowed army. That was enough to get me hooked.
There's also an app in the store called interference that does the same thing as drawception. 	True, but I've spent a long time playing Drawception and have made friends there during my time so I don't think I'll be switching anytime soon
Don't thread on me	Tread softly because you tread on my dreams🤤
Does DeRon really not practice hard or is Dakich just a colossal fuckbag?	The second one
So all it takes is multiple level 99 magicites, legend dives, and multiple rank 5 abilities honed? OK! 	AND multiple copies of 7-8* +element gear of all types.  That's a crucial part of it to get tenable damage, and I doubt too many of us are ever going to be able to run a gear setup like [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/251340072262041600/397912741106548736/Screenshot_2018-01-03-11-42-59.png) to do it.
This is unrelated but do you still have Max Payne 3 for trade?	Nah man, I traded it 3 years ago.
Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it.	Shouldn't that be shrimep?
Abolishing welfare should be enough.	Abolish welfare, implement the basic income. Problem solved. Or just replace food stamps with money.
I would say to wait until we know more about this story, this is in a book, which means this was based on information from months ago, and it is not the first time people on the left try to divide the republicans via this way.	There's already some suspected inconsistencies in Bannon's time line, which the book relies heavily on.  It's hard to tell for sure since the people speculating are only going off second hand accounts about what's in it.   It's a wait and see.  
Considering 33% of land on earth is a desert... this is a very misleading headline. 	I think that's different. One thing is a "quarter of planet" and another is "land on earth". Just a remind: about 71 percent of the Earth's surface is water-covered.
I have absolutely nothing to lose in this. This is the best trade deal in the history of trade deals.	Obviously, because all the others were trade deals.
I don't have CoS on roll20, but I do have SKT. All of the maps are the player's maps with all traps, secret passages, area numbers, etc. marked out using the GM layer.	Thanks for this. It stands to reason that Curse of Strahd would follow suit.
In before the right claims she's destroying evidence	Oh, that’s good...will it be in tweet form though?
In two days, I already made the same money I made in 2017. Should I just stop?	I made back all of my losses the past two months the past two days. Let's keep doing this.
JP Donaldson bugs me. Uncanny valley stuff there.	The both look the same to me, which doesn't sit right.
DDR3 is no longer being produced. What you see is the dwindling stock and accompanying prices.	Is there any indication when the RAM prices will come down? I am thinking of upgrading later this year but if prices remain insane I might hold off.
As far as Lore is concerned, the Infinite Forest should open the door to explore pretty much any timeframe or encounter inside the simulation.  Hopefully it can be utilized for some fun surprises in the future or past.	&gt; fun surprises in the future or past Yeah, I was just thinking "imagine going to the tower in the past and meeting banshee-21 with a totally different personality".  In the exos, we could meet them with different way and means they are pre-reset. 
Done. Good luck 	Thank you!
Natsyuri? I can get use to this...	Just posted part 2, which should let you get a better feel for it 
You look lovely	I like your name. 
How did Jah do?	He played.
Wow, I actually have had 3 titans all this time and never noticed that. Still, I struggle with what chest piece to use, the only good exotics on titans are their chest pieces, and the only cool looking chest pieces are not exotics. Probably not worth messing with it, since it doesn't increase recovery, which is the only thing that matters.	Skullfort and Synthoceps aren't good?
Home Sense/Winners + RecRoom	I believe they mentioned the same info on CTV news yesterday.
Between FFT Banner and OK banner, which is a safer (and maybe better) banner to pull on? I'm low on mythril and in dire need of a Hastega+Boostga relic and both possess them. I have no dupes on OK banner but have 3 dupes on FFT Banner (Ramza LMR and Marche BSB/LMR).  I also want to know about the other relics on the banner to know which weighs better.  	Do you have a link for those? The upcoming banner resource on the side is a bit out of date, but I'd be glad to read through the selections and give my thoughts.
Bought in at 1 cent. Keep holding people this is just the beginning	Where can you buy them?
I called mine Sanic	It seems you and about 30 other people in this thread. So good job on originality. 
Here is my hard mode entry, with Bill's new favorite docking method (not really) ! https://imgur.com/a/JTeBh I'm still quite a beginner, but I wanted to at least try this challenge, and to my surprise, I didn't fail ! It was my second mission to Duna since I play KSP, and my first manned one. I only did my first landing on the Mun a few days ago, but it's amazing how much we can do by just knowing how to dock and land things, and how fast we can achieve bigger things once we understand how the game works ! 	Good job! 
Why you gotta call out /u/xAIRGUITARISTx like that?	No clue who that is.   If it’s Red Reign; I fully expect a ban 
I for one liked this show. (Skylanders academy)	Can you provide context on what's happening? Beyond the obvious of course.
Pretty sure, you are as official as it gets.  Thx for all your hard work, love reading the write ups!	$10 and I give u link to real draft sheet
My favorite is when they think I'm going to be ashamed of my post history or that it somehow has anything to do with the context of whatever conversation is currently happening.	Indeed, they are that pitiful.

Well boys - I'm taking profits today. Redistributing half of my stack into ETH, ICX, and AION and selling the rest for fiat. I'd say I'm going to try not to come back for a few months, but well.. see you tomorrow (as a hodler).	see you in 15 minutes.
Does anyone have any  book recommendations (runnning related of course) for me, don't mind what it's  about!	Born to Run - Christopher McDougall I found it to be pretty interesting, worth a read. 
&gt;**Space Cannon Offense** &gt;^66.4 This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the “Move Ships” step. 	Thanks very much not sure how a missed that had to a have re-read that section 5 times
Wow we are not even tryna find a replacement? Surely that means that they're confident in convincing him to stay	Lallana is fit again, like a new signing .
In Evolution merchants will carry the (low low) fees for acceping a payment. Why? Because they are the one's who want to get paid. P2P transfers are planned to be completely free even. One problem I'm curious to see an answer for is how to enforce InstantSend from the merchant-side.	Don't forget, Merchants will no longer have to suffer from, (unfair) cashbacks.
Many years ago, we joked that the remodeling of our ER would include an entryway in the form of a CT scanner. Basically, every patient coming in to the ER would have to do so by passing thru the scanner. So it's not a new thing ... as a neurologist, I find this somewhat frustrating and inelegant. But so many things are ... sigh ... 	ABCs of emergency medicine: Analgesia Bloods CT scan Disposition Enjoy time off
Do any other devices disconnect from your router's wifi when using the same channel? If you got 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz under the same SSID and if you have a slim/pro and which are not in the same room as the router it could be picking up the 5 GHz signal. If you don't have the Pro or Slim then this would not be the issue. Try unplugging the router for 30 seconds and power it up again.	&gt; All other devices are working fine. I have an original model PS4 about 2 years old

I've always been slightly jealous of people with parents who enjoy video games.	The fondest memories I have of my late dad are me and him online gaming together. Use to play legend of Mir back in the early 2000’s then went into WoW together. 
Was the question specifically about food?	yes, food and drink items only
High. You are very high. 	High on adrenaline 
Hey you dropped something. What? Your standards hi I’m Ash!	Perfect

But Sarah Sanders said no one would be interested in that trash. And Sarah Sanders NEVER lies and is NEVER wrong. 	Yes and she wants you to look her in the eyes, if you can.
Can we maybe think about stopping all the Barco tweets until something official is announced?	Yeah there are so many conflicting reports that it seems we can only rely on official news from the clubs now
What about Stellars own decentralized exchange? 	URL?
Yes this was all in their proposed  heterogeneous processor design. Zen CPU + Vega GPU + HBM with a unified memory controller 	Wow, I didn't know that.  Thanks!
Robocop vs Terminator	Well Robocop does take over the streets like a Farmer's Market.

That guy, you want to charge?	You mean a foreign actor involving themselves in our election and candidate?  Hmm, seems to me if this were reversed you would be up in arms. 
[Just leaving this here](https://i.imgur.com/q48bJ.gif)	Smart move, he doesn't want to get #metoo'd
Bioshock or Bioshock Infinite 	The problem you run into: a movie would only be worth it if the story was taken exactly from the game, yet a movie wouldnt be worth making if it were exactly like the game
He’ll keep him around, I mean, someone needs to be thrown under the bus.	Nah, Kizer has already been fused into the road from being thrown under the bus by Hue so often. Why else would we supposedly draft a quarterback with the first pick? Hue’s “quarterback whisperer” reputation demands sacrifice to be kept amongst the media!

I have a big photo recap/breakdown of my Sobo thru hike from this summer coming! I'll make sure to post here for sure.	Awesome, looking forward to it! I would ask you about the hike but I'll save that for when you post the pictures.
Love the horror vibes here really been needing cthulu and cftbl 	I'll be getting every horror pop I can get my hands on!
At this time in the market, my portfolio has reached some ridiculous all time highs. I’ve been in since May and I plan on staying for the long term with several good quality projects. Does anyone have tips on handling when you reach insanely new all time highs? I’m holding more than I could have ever imagined, and it scares me because I know corrections are definitely a part of the process.	Just don't look at it or treat it as fake. Helps me not take it too close to heart. If you survived other dips, you should be good
The faster I'm driving the more attention I'm paying. Tbh if I'm stuck going to the speed limit or under my eyes will wander. Its just mind numbing 	Seriously, I drive at least 500 miles a week, and sometimes I sit in the right lane at the speed limit on cruise and I invariably almost fall asleep about an hour into my trip. It's genuinely dangerous. 
My grandpas workshop was called "Close Enough Woodworking". Love that kind of humor. 	a saying that has helped me through some tough times: "Don't let perfection get in the way of good enough." haha
TBH, I hope they delete this too to tilt you more.	As you wish.
I don't know if I'm in the minority here yet or not, but I really enjoy all of Yoko's songs on *Double Fantasy*. But that's really all the music of hers I know right now.	Everything except Kiss Kiss Kiss was good on that album.
Awesome! What are you going to do with it? 	I'll probably wear it on my school blazer
Oh he's one of those guys that thinks that "scientific theory" is the same as "hypothesis". Here's the example I love to use in situations like that: "Can you believe they teach the Heliocentric *Theory* in schools like it's fact?!  I can't believe people actually *believe* that the *Earth revolves around the sun!*" Lol.	Orbits around the sun, not revolves
Wyd happened to Foirniers hair? Literally had a full head of hair last year, iirc.	Nah he's been thinning pretty bad for a few years

The family is the fundamental building block of conservatism.  The state is the fundamental building block of just about everything else. Accurately describes the failure points of each society as well.
The text is amazing, but everything seems too... out of place. Its so simple, and it looks like a simple design gone wrong. Try to have the pics of the characters to have a similar design to each other. Also try to give more life into the banner. It seems to be very dull and boring. Just some feedback!	thanks for the ideea, I will try to make the next banners less simple and boring
Bi/pansexual people! There's also an orientation called skoliosexual which is people who prefer enbys, they do exist.	I learned a thing today and my mind is blown. Thank you, from an afab pan in a similar situation. 
Ragg socks! https://www.google.com/search?q="ragg+socks"&amp;tbm=isch	Judging from everything I’ve seen that I’ve looked up, LL Bean are the only way to go for these, right?
What exactly is the question? And what’s the “beauty” you’re referring to in your title?	Sorry for the inaccuracy, "beauty" refers to guitar as an instrument itself. May be a stereotype, but I heard that one should learn it using an acoustic one, that's why I asked if it is possible to learn using an electric.
“Secure software” just hasn’t had its vulnerabilities found or disclosed yet. 	I mean isn't that a given? Not that I am versed in IT but if it's made by humans, that means it can be broken through by humans.

If you already have the solution at 30mg to 30ml, I think just add 9ml to every mg to get 300ml to 30mg. Or just do a 10ml to 1mg solution.	So if i add 9ml to 1mg, It will definitely be 100ug? I wanna be sure. Thank you for the advice

you could run a hybrid. basically you look for speed and zone in a 4-3 backer and blockshed and pwm/fnm is 3-4 backer. Justin Houston is a 3-4 backer while Atwater would be better in a 4-3. 	ahhh gotcha, thanks for your help

*The* Fleetwood Mac? It's just Fleetwood Mac. And while we're at it, it's just Eagles, not *The* Eagles.	Oh sorry just noticed, I can’t edit it now right? Sorry it’s just i like putting “the” behind the band name without realising.
A lot of the aspects of programming. Did I mention I have a programming job? I feel like my life right now is that old "I have no idea what I'm doing" meme.	I get you. I've been programming almost three years (complete career change) and I'm pretty comfortable doing my job. But. When I go to meeting and other people talk about what they're doing... I'm glad nobody ever asks me questions in meetings.
I would ask about your status so I would know. You should also know and figure out if she is worth your while. Is she messing with you? Or does she truly love you?	What do you mean by "living a lie"?
Gwent	i see what you did there...
This time the saints are missing a key oline man seeing how they will make adjustments over the week its still a cause for concern for them.	Pear was the guy we lost. He's been in and out at points this season. The backup has had some experience, far from ideal still. But he's no newbie to starting now. 
The Thing (1982, haven't seen the newer one yet) is pretty good. Also Trick 'r Treat! A good comedy horror I'd suggest is Tucker and Dale vs Evil! It's awesome! Also Cabin in the Woods is really great!	I’ve saw all of those except the new The Thing. I’ve heard a it’s very bad compared to the original. Trick R Treat needs a sequel.
Probably ant man had a late start to life and doing everything I can now for my baby on the way. 	Aw, congratulations! I hope all goes well with the delivery.

Pick up Roquan Smith if he's available (big if), and ideally one of Vita Vea or Maurice Hurst with the other pick.	I also like the idea of Roquan Smith and either a RG or RT at 22. 
If she didn't write in the card make sure you use it for her birthday. 	Either use the same card or write on the envelope again.
I think it's most likely the recent releases i.e. the 2011 blu-ray releases.	Which is kind of weird to think the theatrical releases aren't canon.
The volume is really low and it bothers me. But the actual music is great.	Yeah the volume is really low and something about the mix is off for me, it’s a shame because it would make the album a lot better (don’t get me wrong, it’s already great).

Meh. I don’t see him fitting in a team like Juve. A team where even the strikers comeback and help out in defense. Also, where would he go? Dybala’s position? Pjanic position? Put him on the wing? No room really, unless Allegri wants him in place of Matuidi / Khedira... very unlikely. 	I can see him in a christmas tree formation as the 2-man AM with Dybala.
It's a good day. It's only been 6 days, but I'm already more conscious of "head hunger" (I am having a stressful thought/feeling, or I'm bored, or I'm thirsty, and it makes me want to eat) vs "stomach hunger" (my body wants food.) AND even when I am hungry, it's not a hypoglycemic hangry emergency. Like, it's ok if I can't eat right now. And it's worth it to take the time to make something that's good for me. Part of this is keto, and part of it is mindfulness. All of it is good! Also, hit my first weight goal this morning, which is my previous highest weight. Which is kinda frustrating (coz omg how did I get here) but also good coz now I'm in familiar territory. 	That's impressive for only 6 days! Go you! I still get hangry but not as often.

In replacement of my own body? Or just under the floor boards with the others?	Why not both?

No I'd call Toriyama and demand he change it.	Dewit!
What are you all using for Kirna's Stones? I've been using ST/Ardor Reflex/WW AS/Thunder Defense for all the crit res, but I was wondering if anyone has had better luck running something like Dark HP in the Prism instead of Thunder Def	the number one player in the global server has DM+HOM LUQ on his kirna. He runs aiolos to compensate for the lack of heals. Most common ive seen on the other hand is ST-ardor reflex- green as or green dr and blue def in prism
That PUBG swim speed actually gets more interesting when you consider that 6 mph is Michael Phelps's top speed, not average speed. For comparison, the world record in 50m freestyle (the event that should have the highest average speed) is currently held by Cesar Cielo (using the long course record). His time was blazing fast 20.91 seconds. That gives him an average speed of 2.39 m/s or 5.35 mph. That makes the PUBG character 16.4% faster. It's even more impressive when you consider that the PUBG character doesn't dive into the water at the beginning and is probably going to travel more than 50m.	Phelps is not swimming for his life though. Also, no pan.
Thinking of trying to double dip BoA cards. Premium Rewards &amp; Alaska personal. Any reason to do one before the other? I've had one Alaska card opened last year and closed last month. Lol/24	Premium first definitely. A lot of people get approved for the latter despite getting denied for the former. It would just make it easier for the auto-approval system to approve you for the premium without the Alaska so fresh on your report. 
A boyfriend or girlfriend who is sensitive to and supportive of your bond with your pet is somebody who gets you. Put a ring on it! 	The dog would look silly with a ring on his finger.

Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty happy about this signing, but I'm also quite surprised that it was Preller who contacted Cameron about working for the Padres, since Cameron wrote a [pretty scathing piece](https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/it-feels-like-the-padres-got-off-easy/) on the Padres, specifically Preller, about the whole medical records thing.	I would hope that Preller would hire the best man for the job, regardless of past personal differences.
i want to lose enough to feel confident in getting a tattoo (which will be my first), and be able to show it off :) it'll be a gift to myself once i reach my gw/ugw	Oh nice, do you know where you are going to get the tattoo, and what it will be of? If you don't mind me asking. 
I'd argue this isn't the correct subreddit for that article/discussion. That being said we all know racism is bad and we should not encourage it, but how do you fix an issue like this?	You could mandate that resumes must be reviewed 'blind', ie with the name and other ethnically identifying features removed wherever possible. I suppose there's an enforcement problem there, but it'd probably be a reasonable step.

Seems like a reasonable thing to concern themselves with.. meanwhile there's whole blocks of squatters, trap houses, and abandoned blighted trash everywhere surrounding some of the schools.. i.e. the blocks surrounding EEV Prep..

They do, however, have control over many of their closed schools, which are among the worst blight in the city.

Honestly, if I had to take one pair of shoes, I would go with a well made pair of boots. Doc Martens are my go-to, but they're not the look for everyone. They do work in most weather, even rain, and can still look nice if taken care of. I've cleared 10 miles a day in them without issues. A decent set of insoles can also be a lifesaver.	Same here. If I could only have one thing, i would use my chesea boots or possibly higher boots if it’s cold/wet. I usually go with boots and sneakers.

Exercise, you don't have to go to the gym everyday or do a random sport, just a few tweaks can help a lot, use the stairs instead of the elevator, walk to work instead of taking the car(this is for the people who don't make a 1h drive to work, of course), while brushing your teeth do some squats.. anything is better then nothing 	Yes! Exercising is a godsend. Whether you're trying to get stronger, look better, or just want to feel better, moving around helps. I find that going to the gym after work is super meditative for me, and helps clear my mind after a stressful day.

Went to an Asking Alexandria show in Seattle. It was the lead singers birthday or something and he was so trashed. He was laying on the stage and the other band members were like "Does anyone in the crowd know the words to this song?" So someone from the crowd was doing the vocals while he laid on the stage. Sidenote: people in the mosh pit were sitting down, which I guess signifies disrespect to the band. 	That's just wholly disrespectful to your fans. I can't stand that rockstar mentality. You owe your fans for the money you make, have a bit of dignity and respect.

Kalisto is truly great at three star gold, probably the second best acro behind AJ. Most people prefer Seth because of the allure of a choose move. As the hp creeps higher at the higher breakpoints of three star silver and gold, Seth NXT really gets outmatched while Kalisto is very much able stand toe toe with the top of the line guys like TUF and Cass. Sidenote, getting Seth to 5k is very important since he is a great trainer but I would suggest stopping there. 	I agree.

XP gain didn't affect your light level, what you needed were either powerful engrams or Exotics since you reached the softcap. XP only affects your illuminated engrams which are from Eververse.

Definitely drop rainbow aura, the buff is meaningless when your l/d is only 5/6*.and 9* IB, find something better to replace Das if you can't take him further. 	That's what I was thinking, or maybe swap my team for another aura since I could have 3 high end fortress once I have enough fodder (ormus, ib, Sigmund) or just make a higher end team without aura 
Coraline Edit: typo 	Well I am still creeped out by it now. 
Buying travel gifts is just f*kin difficult haha, I try to buy something but I just can't find anything unique. By the way, I am in Madrid and the only is edible are ham or torrones, which I think that is pretty strange to give to mostly early 20s male friends. Any suggestions?	You'll also want to look at what you can import. I'm pretty sure you'll not be able to take meat products back. But you'll want to check.

I just threw a video up about it for those interested. https://youtu.be/J3lrfJ8amEQ I think these guys have nailed it now. I wasn't a fan of the increased shimmering after the last patch so this was a nice surprise. Bit planet games should be commended for doing right by the community and being so quick on the draw with patches.	Thanks for your video! I haven't picked this game up yet, but super tempted!
I'm pretty sure someone called a strike team on you from their facility.	How do you do this? 
I'm honestly really impressed with the turnaround the Saints have accomplished this year.  They really looked like a team that was going to be irrelevant this year due to their roster issues last few years.  Win or lose, was a good job getting this far.	Yeah, most fans are happy with the season. We want to win this, and I think we have the talent to still pull it off, but I also think most of us knew this was going to be tough and many expected the Vikings' Defense to win this.

In 7th grade I did a report on the dude that came up with the internet and I froze in front of the class, locked my knees, had to be helped back to my desk from almost passing out, and then cried into my hands as quietly as I could.	Yo that's pretty bad. Mad respect for making it back to your desk tho!
Not your problem and there's literally nothing you can do about it anyway	That's what I figured, thanks for your input. 
I see a Nissan GT-R, I upvote. 	I was so enthralled I almost forgot to upvote. I want one so bad and I’m slowly saving to buy one (hopefully new).
Mid 2015 to mid 2016 was a down or stagnant time for most major stocks and indexes. I'll take that as the "correction" for the previous 5 bullish years. So in comparison, we should have about 3 more years until the next minor correction. Gotta think positive. 	I like your thinking :)

Everyone's saying that the Hornets say no, but I think this is a gamble well worth exploring for the Hornets. The Hornets are going to have to trade Kemba in the next two years, and Fultz offers absurd upside. He has his obvious risks, but Kemba isn't going to get you a  #1 pick. Tho I would be suspicious if the Sixers were willing to do the trade, that would mean they really think something is wrong. 	You just explained why this trade wont happen. As a Hornets fan I rather have Convington and Philly's 1st. I don't want Fultz at all.
I bought one. The drivers desperately need polishing as installing the gaming driver took me hours to figure out (thankfully folks on this sub helped immensely). But once the drivers are set up right, the gaming performance is great. I have no complaints.  I have a sweet 3440x1440 FreeSync display and have been waiting a long time to get a worthwhile card to replace my 290x. 	I decided to wait for a water cooled Vega 64 if that will ever happen haha

Why are you having to do all that?  Why isn’t the MP team working to get on exchanges?  They’ve been on ED since last fall! If you recall, they made the genius move of allowing tokens to hit ED while the ICO was still running!	You're right.  I'm pulling out. If GMT gets closer to getting on exchanges I'll come back... maybe.  It's a great project but I'm not even sure why they released a token if they're not going to try to get on exchanges.

WHat are your pet's current stats?	Hey thanks for commenting, I posted the picture in the comments. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/0zEvI) is what I'm working with right now. 
I believe in a higher self who has multiple lives, and karma plays a factor in what my next life will be. I believe in life energy (such as chi/ki/qi) that can be used for healing. I feel close to nature and believe the earth provides a flow of energy that can be interacted with by beings who are spiritually aware of it. It sounds kooky, but it makes more sense to me than Mormonism ever did, and I don't have to be part of any religion to believe or practice it. TL;DR I have no idea what my label would be. I guess I'm spiritual? Perhaps agnostic? Geez I dunno...	&gt; TL;DR I have no idea what my label would be. Pantheist? Labels tend to get hard when you try and tag them onto real people.

This is awesome and I'm happy for her! I'm also kinda pleased about a DPS main coming out as a trans woman. Everyone always comments on how so many prominent trans players are support mains.	I think a lot of transwomen tend to overembrace femininity when they're early in. Comes with often not having had positive female role models, I guess? 
The problem being that if this was an option, the vast majority would pick "Fill, except support" and it would be the same problem that they had before autofill - albeit a little less, but still relevant.	But I always pick Support/ Fill but still sometimes get jungler which I really don't want.
Just moved to Melbourne for Uni (UniMelb) and living in Carlton. Can anyone recommend a gym nearby that is affordable and well equipped? I'm looking for plentiful free weights, cardio and good equipment, I don't particularly care for classes, spas/saunas and high fees...	Carlton Baths. It's a YMCA. Lots of free weights, two squat racks, bunch of assorted equipment, bikes, rowers and many treadmills (for a smaller gym anyway)

In any given year even the worst team wins around 60 games, and even the best teams lost 60. That said this being the midterms I'll be busy trying to help my other team win seats this year.	  Something in the small 60s is a contender. 40 %, is a deep loser. We are fighting for that 20 percent in the middle. Tigers would need a lot of luck.

I thought Boris said the NHS should be getting £22.8bn? &gt;Mr Johnson defended the gross figure, and argued that it would rise to **£438million** by 2020. “There was an error on the side of the bus,” Mr Johnson said. “We grossly underestimated the sum over which we would be able to take back control.”	Was that underestimate maybe the difference in the value of the pound between then and now?

Not that anyone was clamoring for them, but Foreigner and Whitesnake are playing the Concord Pavilion on August 3rd.  http://www.concordamp.com/	Both marked as out for now, I agree that neither would likely ever be booked but if it turns out it's not equal billing I'll probably remove Whitesnake from the out section.

get some rubbing alcohol on those buttons and clean them up a bit, light sanding on the part and it will look better than new!	Unless the button material has started to break down already, then you end up with something that resembles used chewing gum. I had at least two old remotes with iffy material, turned into goop while trying to clean.
The first time I heard "My name is Craig Grant and THIS is my Bitttt-coin wallet" I got a scammy vibe	That guy is the epitome of a scam, and he knew that, hence the recruitment of CryptoNick and Trevon James.
Don't care what anyone says, Frank is a good dude and is someone who I want to help. 	You and me both! He is just one of those people who you can’t help but love, and want to help where you can. 
Playing on play grounds. Slides are awesome and swings are the best. 	Spent the last month visiting my three year old grandson. Playgrounds are even more fun with a kid who wants to play on them with you. 
**SO** happy Miranda/Nym cheese lost... even if it lost to the second cheesiest list possible.	Three Nus isn't cheese though? If you mess up the approach you can very easily lose the game.
New York City!! I went a few years ago for Christmas and it was wonderful. The big tree at Rockefeller Center, all the department stores decorated, saw the Rockettes Christmas show, ice skating at Bryant park,  I could go on. It was cold but not unbearable, just bundle up. 	[It is a pretty fine place around Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS_ty5o7x4)
'putting it away for 10 years' LOL Bitcoin is software. You cant 'put it away for 10 years'. It will change, go obslete, etc. 	Bitcoin is already 9 years old 
The sprites in the SNES game we’re *so* beautiful and hold up well even today. These cheap, iOS-type polygons look awful.	So, play the SNES version then.
I doubt we'll be getting a crimson for a long time since what everyone ignores is that P3 and P4 were for the PS2 and the only reason we got P3P and P4G is because they were brought onto the handheld systems. If we were going to get a handheld version then it would have been announced with P5 just like Dancing moon and the other one were announced for both the Vita and PS4. They would have to redo P5 pretty much from scratch to add a female, they would have to redo every line to change it from him to her and then redo the voice lines. Let's not forget that P3 went from a full 3d world to a visual novel where you can click on up to a dozen spots and read text. 	Thank you. People act like remaking P5 is so simple and that’s it a given because of previous updates. The game is also significantly bigger than the others. But who knows, it is Atlus and they squeeze as much money as they can from consumers 
I have the same color mod but still using the 3ml tank. That looks nice!	Thank you!
The defense needs serious help and the team could always get a good #2 receiver to compliment Hill. Letting Smith and DJ go will hurt but will provide the cash needed to score some upgrades. It's true but sometimes you have to give up some things in order to invest in the future. Mahomes should be ready next year and the defense unfortunately is getting old and needs to be replaced with younger talent. 	I’d say Albert Wilson is an excellent receiver. He made a lot of plays when we needed them this season. 
Not at Michigan it doesn't.	Which is strange, since recruiting (and *cah-razy* recruiting antics) seems to be all that matters to Michigan.
The one on Peachtree or the one near Moscow? edit: ^^/s	I'm so sad you needed to add /s
Is that a bug or feature? Edit: I'm referencing a incident with Bethesda, stop wondering if I'm serious 	Yes
I'd like to take this time to pay homage to those who sold at 850. Press F to pay respects F	F
Some bizarre combo of all of these! If I put Diana level pressure on myself, it never works out! I need the flexibility to sometimes just be minimal, too.	yeah I totally understand, sometime I feel that too
Medication directions: "Eat with food." SO: :::places pills inside peanut butter and jelly sandwich:: ...I wish I were kidding.	Well, technically it is food!!
Got mine going as well. Currently designing a case for it Here is video of some sweet DX action. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv5cHTImqh4	Get your case designed and up for sale! +1 buy :)
Id say Thorn or Claw unless your Hornet is leveled up. Theres a few T8 holes where you need a decent amount of backspin. 	I went through T8 both times with a hornet. I don’t think I ever needed the backspin. 
The desk not even mentioning Taimou as a contender for a widow spot makes me sad, I hope he shapes up 	Given that he's nowhere near the best Widowmaker on his own team, I'd be highly surprised if his name ever gets brought up. Fuel might be better off to just keeping Effect on that?
Hi salawm, thank you for your submission to /r/iamverysmart!

Better luck next time :-)
TIMMYYYYYYYYYY	I think Hardaway has scored as many transition points since he's been back as the Knicks had as a team while he was away.
Awful writing. Simply embarrassing.	I genuinely fell asleep near the end and had to rewatch that part... I guess they let the intern handle the writing for this one.
I never know whether to add "UPVOTE PARTAAAAAAY" because idk whether we want to win or not like were only 13 games from .500 and we've improved a lot	"only 13 games" really

Will the good news ever stop??	Please, no more winning. I can't take it anymore. 
If they came to Atlanta where do you think the would build the HQ? I'm thinking the empty space where the old ~~Ford~~ GM plant was would be pretty attractive as it's right next to a Marta station. However I think you'd have a hard time fitting 50k people in that spot.	You mean the old GM plant in Doraville? That is one of the proposed sites. 
I'm a bit confused, because the thread header of these daily posts always states clearly that "Stellar.org never asks your Secret Key", but if we want to join the community pool we have to input our secret key for the stellar laboratory. Who's right? Edit for specificity: step 8 of how to cast your vote here  https://lumenaut.net/#join	https://lumenaut.net/#join You actually don't have to input your private key to join the community pool- just your Public Address.
If you're looking for cheap but high quality, Audio Technica is a good brand Their most popular headphones are the ATH-M50 or [ATH M50x](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B00HVLUR86) ones 150$ (but you can probably find them cheeper, just be sure to use an official seller), closed back, really good quality for the price Personally I use Audio Technica [ATH-AD700x](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH AD700X-Audiophile-Headphones/dp/B009S332TQ)'s, 105$ and open back with a still quite good sound quality. Since they are open back (and kinda large) I only use them for my computer, Airpods for my phone. (lower quality but very convenient and enjoyable)	ATH M50s are seriously amazing. I got mine in 2010 and they are still going strong
Yes, to get an Autumn Sawsbuck you'll have to catch an Autumn Deerling or Sawsbuck in gen 5 and transfer it, then it'll always be like that, regardless of which gen 6 or 7 game it's in.   For breeding, Deerling inherit the forme of the mother (or father if you're using a Ditto).	man what a hassle! Thanks
Steamed vegetables are fantastic! I've been having a lot of brussel sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower. But am i missing out on anything else that's easily steamable and delicious?	Carrots! 
Finally I have something to do with my 1500+ mats!	Good luck! Hope you get some Masterworks.
I’ll have you know sweaty I am a nc10 in the winter and an nc50 is the summer so tarte definetly gets me 	I am sweaty10 in the winter and sweaty50 in the summer so Farte really understands me too! \#fartelife
In his defense, I do not recall anywhere in the Tutorial that they explicitly explain how to use leadership skills, and the leader spot is not highlighted in any way... Edit: Didn't notice it was GW, my bad.	Yeah, I've been using my strongest toon on leader spot for so long before I realised that I don't have any leadership.
Is there any info on aoe2 definite edition yet? I cant remember, but were they going to make an entire new game or how does this work?	No, there's no info on AoE 2 DE or AoE 4, all we know is that they're planned
This is in really poor taste. Sigh...*unzip*	Yeah she’s nowhere near malnourished enough. 
How exactly does 4x4 parity occur? Is it just random? If two solvers get the same scramble, can one of them have parity and the other doesn't? What about if they both get the same scramble with solved centers?	I believe parity happens due to an odd number of inner slice moves. So different ways of reducing the cube may lead to different parity situations.
Eh, I'm still waiting for the 'rent' bubble to pop. These places aren't staying full and they keep upping it every year.	Well if they've raised rates 20% and had a 10% vacancy rate they're coming out ahead anyways.
Before anyone gets sentimental about Dorsett, i’ll just take this opportunity to remind you that Chester Rogers was matching Dorsett’s production (minus TDs) whilst they were on the team together and Rogers was working as the number 4 WR when Dorsett was number 3. That said, classy from Phillip to ask about Andrew, shows it’s not all just business for these guys sometimes.	Matching his production is a stretch. Dorsett has twice as many yards and catches effectively. Edit: I also don’t get why you’re ignoring the touchdown difference. 
Could easily be covered with a fashionable bandolier.	[Like this ](https://i.imgur.com/Id6fs0B.jpg) 
I mean, in his defense it doesn't seem like the support leads were doing a phenomenal job anyway. Support has been kind of weak for months, so maybe it was performance related and not acquisition related. 	Having used to work at Datto, I'm surprised to read about this. Their hires are usually top notch. What weak spots have you seen in their Support? 
Take my advice on this one: you will be able to work much more efficiently if you get a proper amount of sleep. You may think you're saving time, but you're just making things worse if you're sleepy.	Yeah, I know. A vegetable who's always there is less useful than someone who can actually think but is only there sometimes.
I actually really like this more than the original game. Good job! =) [Also, on the Friday before the festival, what does the note you hand to Monika say?](/spoiler) It seems to be encrypted text but I have no idea how to decrypt it.	it's a sweet message. i won't spoil it here but it's a loving one.
But you haven’t lost your virginity. 	Of course he lost his virginity. Why do you think he's not allowed to be within 100 meters of an elementary school?
Ever since I got these, I’m not willing to get AJ1s with lesser leather.	That makes two of us. No more general releases for me, I'm spoiled now. 
&gt; they would not last a week in our shoes And he wouldnt last a week in the shoes of someone who has an *actual* tough life.	He wouldn't last a week in the shoes of anyone who is expected to be competent and emotionally mature. 
I'm wildcarding this week and I've got a similar midfield but with Mahrez rather than Son. I'm also weighing up Albrighton vs Lingard. And I've Arnautovic as the 5th.	Why not Son? 
When you go to select a quest, out of the four, if I pick one say the experts quest,  what are the numbers in brackets next to the camp?	The numbers are indicators of which zone of the map the camp is in. The maps are seamless, but they're still split into zones to make it easier to remember where things are.
What if it was originally a gummy bear and it sat around for 3500 years and turned into stone? How do we know the ancients didn't have the recipe?	Just like in Jurassic Park!

Does anybody have any tips on how to get into running? I recognize and appreciate that it’s good for you, but I’m finding it boring and difficult to get into.	Why do it if it's boring to you?  I personally don't run because I also find it boring and painful (due to my low arches). There are so many other physical activities that can be fun.  Try rock climbing :)
ICX or REQ	My two biggest holds, in that order :)
Hi, almost the same post as last week but this time i'm early with a finished animation. [Animation](https://imgur.com/a/yUThU) Now i still need to do 2 other animation, one for using the hook from up to down and one for using the rope for going up&amp;down. thx for reading, and if you have some tips don't hesitate to critique my work. 	I like the animation! Very smooth!
Just reset your left controller, hold the windows button to turn it off and back on and it will be fixed. This issue happens to a lot of WMR users	Is it something Gorn specific, because it doesn't happen in any other app.

Anyone else catch Stipe swiping the belt from Dana so his trainers could wrap it around him? Think he’s a little salty about the Ngannou hype the UFC was putting out there 	Missed that, I actually thought Dana was just so bummed Francis lost that he handed the belt over to someone else to give to Stipe. 
i don't get it	To look like he does, he would either have to be about 5”10@239 or 6”3@300. I know this because I used to guess weight at a carnavals in my youth.
Thanks and much love	Anytime! &lt;3 ❤ :) 
Wait... in the background is that a 6ft wall of snow? Cut away so the ice could be accessed for this stunt? Wow!	No, it's the medical tents. They did not set this up just for her, btw, this is a traditional event that occurs the night of January 18th-19th.

I am of the opinion that no one owns a name. So what if her kid has the same name as yours? I don't think that's weird. It's just a name.	You don’t think that’d be confusing to have the same first and last name? My husband is close with his brother so we expect to spend a lot of time together. 
Planned obsolescence everywhere in industry. If everyone stopped replacing their cars and smartphones, imagine the shitstorm	Can confirm. I was a design engineer at an Air Filter manufacturer, I'd say about 15% of my time was spent on making things just right - strong enough such that the element works for 8000 miles and no more or the competitors filter un-installable in our Air box.
Does it happen when you use it without DAW?	Yep I’m not using a DAW at the moment 
I would prefer to make more money and pay more because then I will have more leverage in the relationship. 	How?
How do they avoid double-spent?	It's only for orders up to 0.1 BTC. The resources needed to doublespend XMR for that amount don't really make economic sense for the attacker, I would think.

Allright, so I'm new here and have a question already. I've been looking into blockchain for about 6 months now, and believe I'm getting pretty decent in explaining how the technology works on a basic level. However, the other day, someone asked me a question, to which I think I know the answer, but I'm not really sure. SO here goes: Imagine I'm trying to make a transaction with someone. He gives me his address or public key. I send him some BTC. The transaction gets confirmed, and I'm happy. Now this person claims he didn't receive any, and says I've used the wrong address. In which case, bad luck, right? However, how does this prevent scammers from giving out the wrong addresses (that they own) on purpose, since it will be quite hard to trace the address back to them? Thanks for the replies!	read the bitcoin whitepaper please
I searched through your dotfiles and found the icyinfo.sh script. VERY nice! I'm not sure if you made it, but it looks so great and minimal!	Not it isn't entirely mine. I stole it from u/Eti_f.
My commanding officer twice denied me leave for my wedding as he believed junior officers should not marry until they were Lt (N). The worse was having to cancel all the arrangements just two months before the wedding.	Because you magically change when you get an extra pip/stripe.

I get this every O day! It is uncomfortable but it’s nice to know exactly what day you O. 	So then. Yay??? BD should be interesting 😂
hey man, i had an issue with the in game screen thing. I moved the screen into my game (echo arena) and after i finished playing one round, i noticed the page i had opened was scrolled all the way down. Because apparently i kept on scrolling on the touchpad and aiming it (unintentionally) at the screen. So is there a way to make the in game screen JUST a screen? as in, make it just a viewing window that you cannot use or click on  	There isn’t an option to control whether or not it reacts to input but I think I will just disable input when in overlay mode because it isn’t really helpful I think. Thanks for the suggestion, I’ll make this change with the public release of 1.9 later this week.

1. Zanis is probably the weakest jungler (or character) in the game, so you should probably find someone else to jungle with. 2. Wonderwoman is not a jungler no.	that’s impossible! i’m in gold rank and i️ always jungle with zanis! 
Playing horde. I will never waste money on a useless profession again. Every warrior i made I used to get smithing for rp and such. Such a money and time sink overall for very little payback and not a lot of ways to make money. Happier with no professions or waiting till 60 to power level some thing new 	I still go mining/smithing for a rp perspective fully knowing it's not ideal.  Time is only wasted if you don't like how you spent it.
Was this picture taken on an old Motorola flip phone? Why does it look like it was taken in 240p from 3 meters away and digitally zoomed in 8x?	Well, you got the 3 meters away and digitally zoomed in 8x part right!
Need a center, which players ROS looks better? Henson (with new coach) Skal (with vets being rested) Monroe (with the change to starter)	I would go with Henson. 
Oh wow I love it so much! It's almost every kind of genre that I love, and some of the samples you used gave me some nostalgia because my childhood was full of Kirby and some of those pop songs! You have talent my friend. I hope you create more ^^	Thank you so much for listening and I'm pleased to hear that you had a connection with it. There will be more, I have quite a ways to go. &lt;3
This guy created a gear list for backpacking that only costs $300. There's some great ideas on there on how to save money and what you really need. I think this is a good place to start. https://pmags.com/300-gear-challenge	I feel like you could definitely do better with some Walmart gear and still come in under $300. Ide rather have a $20 backpackers tent from Walmart than a tarp held down with nails or whatever..
Which side is which?	Thought the same thing lol. Both of them are very versatile in their music so it's hard to get to know immediately. Should've been Alestorm and Agathodaimon

Having green eyes. Only 1-2 percent of humans on Earth have green eyes.	Me and my mom are the only people i know with green eyes but its a dark green so people often think theyre hazel, people act like blue is the least common, like i know like 40 ppl with blue eyes and one with green
You can check the patch notes in the orangemushroom website btw.	Did not know that appreciate it.
The properties seem similar, but the math wouldn't add up. As said in *Generations*, the Nexus crosses the galaxy every 39.1 years. The encounter with the Enterprise-B happens in 2293, so a previous Nexus crossing should have already happened in 2354, two years before the current time of *Discovery*, which is set in 2356/2357. Still, I'm also rather convinced that the mycelial network and Stamets's condition will link to something we have already seen in previous shows - the question is rather which of the myriad of seemingly supernatural beings or phenomena that may be. 	How did they exactly figure out that 39.1 years thing? I forget. 
Honda engined just reached 500hp.	But promptly blew up after doing so.
Interested in the Canyon.  I have an RV-5 and could throw in a pickup to sweeten the deal.  Also have a Digiverb.	Hmm.. what kind of pickup?

Wait how? Is it that price everywhere?	I’m guessing OP price-matched to a local Walmart.
PMD	Trade Verified!
Mackay seems to be absent. Did it only qualify as a large town?	It should be on there, because these maps were for places with 100k people or more

Looks like you can't combine this with their other 40% off sale. Unfortunate because I was going to grab that Jane's Addiction boxset	I managed to combine it... Make sure that total price after reduction of VAT is still above 50 pounds. 
By "efficiently" you mean performance? Benchmark it and find out!  But I doubt it. I also doubt the performance differences will matter that much to most uses. But I'd regardless use someone else's mature, robust, and tested LRU cache solution though, if I could find a reasonable one, like the one matthewd links to. 	I don't know, I don't think building a production-grade LRU cache should be considered beyond an average ruby programmer's capabilities. We're not talking about an elaborate piece of machinery like a database.
The Bunham/Sarek connection to me actually increases the size of the world. It gives deeper meaning to the Spock/Sarek story. Want to know what a smaller world of Star Trek really looks like? Just look at the Kelvin films. -Everyone from the TOS show is now at the academy together -The Enterprise is being built not just on earth but in Kirk's own backyard? -It takes mere seconds to travel vast distances -One can be on a planet far away and witness Vulcan being destroyed -Kirk is given the Captains chair right out of school And so on...That is a small universe. 	&gt;-The Enterprise is being built not just on earth but in Kirk's own backyard? What, you've never visited the shipyards in rural Iowa?
The trash has been taken out! Bye Felicia!!	Pretty much so and I'm glad they are gone, they were the worst neighbors we ever had
5 GHz WiFi and more LTE bands so can be used in the USA etc	I second this. I was very disappointed to only get EDGE on my Swift 2+ when I went to New York, even 3G would have been good.
That's what happens if you launch a game in a non native resolution (IE, 900p on a 1080p monitor) and for me atleast, if you launch it in fullscreen. it shouldnt be anything to worry about	&gt; Nope, my pc actually fully freezes to the point where I can't close it using Alt-F4 or task manager. I am forced to manually turn it off otherwise it won't work. 
I knew he played the sax, but I didn’t realize it went this far back. Not exactly the easiest instrument.	I think he turned professional at the age of 16, i.e. when this picture was taken.
Why was 16 afraid of 30? Because seventeen, thirty ate. 	YAAAAAAAAAA BABY
So will TW Wonderments go up in price or down? 	most likely down, it seemed more like manipulation when their price rose by 70+ in a few days.

Top comment on his tweet: Barnacules Nerdgasm ‏Verified account @Barnacules 1h1 hour ago Replying to @Boogie2988 I've been on their show a few times, always had a good time. 	I mean, when you've had to hunt for food your whole life, everything's a good time comparably.

I'll trade nitros for you velocities 1:1	Hey man, I’d like this too if you’ve got more nitros!
I don’t get MBs who insist sick nannies come to work. Do they want their children to get sick too???	Not only that but making your nanny come in sick shows a lack of empathy and compassion. 
This might be controversial but it's rare for a single guy not to have feelings for his close female friends. Why wouldn't he want to get even closer if you connect well and care for eachother? It's what you're already looking for in a partner.	Also, propinquity, the idea that you fall in love with people you see often. 
I want a T-Rex. :D	Right? Direhorns are lazy, we have a ton of them. An oondasa mount would have been better
Nice catch! Did you just think of this?	In the shower. I thought that was a requirement.

That is the saddest, thinnest lasagna I have ever seen :(	Haha it was also the best lasagna I've ever eaten. There were a lot of layers, just very thin (and very thin pasta as well). 
welp, I don't care about this anymore.	ooooh yall bois be downvoting me now? aiight.

Winds howling.	Indeed
Honestly, not a huge fan of this... Champion vs champion sounds cool and all, but I'd rather see both champions hold it down their respective division. We already had Conor go to 155, holding up the 145 lb division, and now we have this whole DJ/TJ thing, and now Stipe vs DC. It kinda feels like a big mess. 226 Takes place in July, DC wants to no longer be fighting after March of next year once he turns 40... I was thinking DC would fight Gus once more, and then perhaps another fight after him and then retire. I'm sure it'll be a great fight and I'm a big fan of both guys, just not a huge fan of the fight taking place. 	You're not taking into account that DC and Stipe cleared out their entire division. This is the only fight left to make at this point. 
I have the husky version of her. Great looking doggo btw	Thank you!
Not too bad	Yeah, I often feel like I should be worse when I'm home alone, just because I have the chance to, but there's nothing really I want to do that is too disgusting.
What time zone are you in?	Central but we have gamers that are spread out in different time zones.
Conflict = Batman, Courage = half Batman, Grow = Batman's ear	same. except instead of half batman, sq root and upside down sq root.
For me it's a tie between Horus Aximand, Kyr Vhalen, and Skraal.	Skraal wins for best archetypical World Eater name.

Is Kenobi actually confirmed now?	It should be here....but it isn't.
They also took it off corporate Kane and TLO Taker. Anyone with the other Kanes or Undertakers know if any of them have the Raw or Smackdown links?	Striker Kane lost his Smackdown link, but I believe that powerhouse Kane, who I don't think had a Smackdown link, now has a Raw link.
Im not seeing the trade. Could you link me to it? was it via Pms?	If you are still willing, tomorrow I can supply 12 garlic for 2 copies?
Thats my MVP	I believe his TS% this season is currently ahead of that of the 2015-16 mvp season. We needed all his points today as KD and Klay were relatively quiet and Kyrie was cooking. Yea, my MVP
In all honesty : how do we have one cameraman, from a stationary location, that provides most relevant footage of the stuff we actually want to see? Usually its filler interviews, lapping cars in irrelevant positions, and sleeping fos in turn 6? Abd that is a team of people. 	I’d love to have this guy for Supercross. They have the worst camera director in all of professional sports. 
Still behind the guy running.	But who is gonna be more fatigued? The guy who runs the steps each of the 4-5 laps or the guy who never taxes his body like that? It’s all about shaving a few seconds here and there. 
Where Is Bon-Bon it might as well be pink Freddy without Bon.	Well, for one- FFreddy is left handed. He holds his mic in his left hand and Bon-Bon in his right hand, and guess whaaaat... His Right hand is going out of the picture, so technically he's still FFreddy through and through :v

W2L -TroyBoi Baseline sitting at 31-32 Hz has to be one of the lowest for any EDM song. 	This song has something strange in the baseline that creates a very low almost harmonic (not sure that’s the right word).  It’s like the frequency is so low, each crest of the single bass note is distinctly felt. https://open.spotify.com/track/39jfJXs2uYHmpU3zotxEkj?si=QBSMjxKdS1y41AUHopVyJQ 
So sad that Morgan went. I hope she gets brought back, because I want to see more of her on the show. Definitely gone too soon, and while I understand why Dela did it I was so frustrated.	It was also so hypocritical, especially in how she phrased it. "I'm going to eliminate the strongest competitor because she said that's what she would do later on. We can't have that happen." Uh... but you just....
Life is rooting for you, wherever it takes you. OR wherever YOU take it. You will make it good.	Thank you very much &lt;3
That Alex Smith to Jarvis Landry connection is going to be looking good in Brown and Orange :D 	Reading that made me realize that your team really needs to change the orange.

1.079 million on twitch alone, setting a new record	Literally rebroke the record for concurrent twitch viewers that was set by the previous Eleague major. Makes you wonder why overwatch was named the number one esport in 2017. 
So, balor gets eleminated and then come as demon balor in 27?	I would love this
Good for you. Owning up to yourself can be the hardest thing to do somtimes	Owning up is probably the only first step I can take to moving on either way. 
Every single part of the car is manufactured using parts that were manufactured with petroleum products. 	Charged with power from a fossil fuel power generating station. 
Have you used training room? Have you thought about using it more?	I'm usually in it between matches and I've spent some time there without queueing, I can definitely feel myself steadily improving, my win % went from about 12 to 30. But yes, I definitely do think about using it more!

Very nice! Did you take pictures of the models with this scene already in mind? Asking because it seems that in both cases the main light source comes from where the beam sabers are, wich gives it the proper lighting and a very cool effect IMHO.	I based the poses on one of the key moments of "The Clash with the Red Comet" episode then i just tried to add effects. haha

The length of time people can hold their breath underwater. 	I'm more impressed with how well they can see underwater.
I agree the intro is really annoying. I'd rather have a skip button and wait 10 secs than having to spam press a. I also wish they had some kind of report function as well because half of my games get decided by leavers. It's stupid regardless whether they are on my team or not. 	Can't even go do something else

u/xXx_th3fall3n_xXx posted a breakdown of the dates, but not the time. It looks like it would end at midnight tonight. Not sure the time zone tho. 	Thanks for the mention, I apologize for the confusion but the website says it's until the 29th while in game shows it's until the 30th. I'm waiting for a confirmation as I'm typing this. 
I'm curious to see how Control Paladins and Control Mages do after the nerfs. Those are my favourite deck styles to play.	I've grinded control mage for several seasons and I'm optimistic for its future. As other people have mentioned, control warlock is a very good deck against cubelock, and this would be a meta where control mage would shine since it has a very favorable match-up against control warlock.
Brae, that was incredible! The tension of being caught, combined with the burning need to touch yourself made for a great listening experience. I would love to hear you enjoy the full array of your toys, at home, where you can really let yourself go and fully experience the playground of your mind/body. Oh, and your voice is downright sultry...mmm...whew..LOL. 😉	Why thank you so much for such a great comment! Truth be told, still a little light-headed from earlier ☺️ Yes, I def plan to make some home-session audios - stay tuned!
Someone offered klay thompson for him would any of u pull the trigger if he was offered for your lou?	Do it, high chance Lou gets traded and his usage drops
The G933 is fantastic, solid sound quality and very long battery life (12hrs). I've never regretted my purchase.	Thank you! Will do more research on this one! 
should I apply to ots before ojt or during? i'd like to commission in the near future. can you apply to ots during tech school?	You need a year at your first station before you can apply. And the standards don't change, so if a terrible GPA and no accomplishments to make you stand out kept you from applying as a civilian, it won't look any better as enlisted.
I cringe when people try to say they don't have to get out of a vehicle on a traffic stop. 	Someone in the comments pointed out that he was incorrect on that point but he argued that they were wrong and wouldn't listen. He's going to get someone hurt.
And that's why you always install GFCIs in your house.	That’s why he extended the power from a non-GFCI outlet. It’s a scary level of detail.

Which version FortiClient? If it’s not 5.6.x bin it and get 5.6 (it is supported with fortios 5.4.x) - there was a major flaw in the pre 5.6 drivers causing connection issues like this.	5.4.3.0870, will update and report back.

[Bill Gates is donating 100mil to cure Alzheimer's,](http://time.com/5124575/bill-gates-father-alzheimers-disease/)	Doesn't he have $90 billion though? That's like someone with a net worth of $100k donating $111. 
this lineup is weak sauce. idk if it's because i'm getting older and no longer in the target demographic, but virtually no lineups this year have been appealing to me.	I feel the same way and I really think i’m just tremendously washed. 
See if you can find a 2017 sport. It has a lot of the upgrades like push-button start and the cloth 'clark plaid' seats that everyone loves. And it has be best wheels in my opinion.	I wish I could, best of both worlds,but I've looked within a 150 mile radius on auto trader and nothing.
I don’t understand the Jets comment.  If they want to pay the cash, I think they are the obvious choice, along with Jacksonville.	And how are the Browns not an obvious option if you’re talking cash?
None of those PGs have a transcendent talent playing alongside them (with the exception of Dennis Smith Jr with Dirk, but he's well past his prime). And most of them are the best players on their respective teams. Not a useful comparison. 	Teams with rookie PGs playing 25mins+ 08-09 Thunder 23-59  (KD's sophomore year) How about that? Useful enough? 
[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timerider:_The_Adventure_of_Lyle_Swann) a mostly forgotten movie from 1982 has two bootstrap paradoxes in it. First A man's grandmother gives him a locket and says that a stranger gave it to her long ago. The man gets caught in a time travel experiment and ends up in the old west where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman. As he is about to return to modern time she keeps his locket, indicating that she is in fact his grandmother, and by implication he is his own grandfather.  	That sounds like a certain Futurama episode
I'm so tired.... Parents of RAOA: how do you adjust and survive on minimal and interrupted sleep? P.S. I'm not a parent, but I figure they are the experts...	Lots and lots and lots of caffeine. 
&gt; Women are good to a certain level and then their bodies change. They reach puberty. They are not as strong and probably more emotional. Their skills deteriorate much faster. The girls get the hormones and become slaves to their ovary induced mood swings. What if Medvedeva has PMS during the Olympics?	I'm so glad someone else mentioned that quote. Ridiculous.
How much coin are you averaging a day?	Hmm, I see.. let me re-think my offer. I‘ll calculate again later today ;-)
I did really liked this, although I will say that if getting rid of it helped performance in someway I am willing to sacrafice it...	I may be wrong, but I think the performance issue would be more so "client-side" and could be avoided by allowing players to turn it off or on (like Vsync for example) pending on their pc. Edit: Also, for consoles (although I'm not as familiar with their settings). 
16 days out from my mock meet, looking to get 1200lbs (435/290/475) at least. So itchy to hit some opener testers next week, should be fun. And crypto mining now makes more than my 1 shift a week at the gym, which is nice. Want to buy some new gear with it I think	~~Want to buy some new gear with it I think~~ *reinvest profits into more mining rigs*
When you are farming SR fodder from magna bosses, do you also do normal showdons or only hard?	Depends on how much you value your time and AP. I wouldn't recommend doing Normal outside of Magnafest when it's free.
Mine is to average 4 mins.....	4 minutes?! That is lucky! I can get 4 minutes just looking for the television remote!
"her mental health? Oh yes, she's much better now, thanks! A lot less drama, and being away from her abuser means she's not being triggered into fight or flight all the time. Thanks for checking, how are you?"	That’s exactly what he replied! I’ve been living happier than I ever have!! out of bed, eating normally, exercising.. had no clue this had to do with her.. until I did!!
Shit...Is there any way I can prevent this from happening to me? Could a relatively new card, that's mining for ~8 hours a day, go out like this?	Undervolt and overclock for roughly the same performance and less stress
Nice! Anybody recommend something a little cheaper? Lol	https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZ2FRP2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 It isn't *a ton* cheaper but I've been using mine constantly (gen1) for over 2 years with no problems. It was as low as $80.00 during the last sale.
I'm pretty sure It's the average card level of that rarity in the deck. For example one of my decks is: 11.5/9/-/2 11.5 would mean I have 2 level 11 commons and 2 level 12 commons 9 means the average of my rares are level 9 (even though it's actually 8 and 10) - means I don't have any epics 2 means average of level 2 legendaries.	K thx dis helped
Teach kids interesting stuff. Get them interested. Dont teach just to have them memorize for a test, which they'll eventually forget anyways.	The best classes I took involved actually doing things and making things.
The thing with Aurora is, is that she needs a babysitter. Her in a trilane with Grock and Ruby makes people throw their phone out the window out of frustration, but Aurora alone can't really do much	Any trilane with Grock is a nightmare!
Just baffles me... they serve their time yet we still find ways to continue punishing them after they have completed their sentence. Edit: My fault for not reading the article and going by the headline. Sorry folks... got lazy.	Read the article – the judge ruled that Florida's excessively strict voting restoration system is unconstitutional, not the overall concept of restoring voting rights to ex-felons.
Komrad is down, play song of Glorious Motherland to restart	Play song of Glorious Motherboard
Which chapter do we get Vaan?	You get him near the end of chapter two.
Favorite lidstrom story is when he came into  the league as a rookie and asked for number 9. They just pointed up to the rafters and gave him number 5 instead	So he said, "Ok I'll put number 5 up there too."
What if him saying I will show you de wae ...was where he wants to be buried.	Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
It was an Hardware Issue. Check Your Printer settings on “Control Panel” Fix any issue is Appear. Reinstall your Printer Driver. &amp; What type of OS you are using?

I'll check HP support https://imgur.com/a/l82wJ Here are some pictures of some sample prints.
If Linkzr is out for Houston and Jehong is out for Seoul for tomorrow’s match, which team would have the advantage?	Seoul. Tank and support matchups are even with Jehong out. Big loss in DPS for Houston though. Fleta, Bunny, Wekeed too strong.
Fireworks for a key?	No thank you sir, I think I can do better
Man, I’m still watching this. Been sharing it with everybody.	Thank you!! It's awesome that this took off kinda, this and the clean version combined have about 100,000 views in a week! 
Was that charging? Great shift from that line. 	I don't think so. Didn't look like he left his feet, wasn't late, and he glided the last two strides. It may have been a touch high though, so I'll wait for a better replay before calling it totally clean. 
Man, can we get this it's own proper page and ToC and chapter pages somehow? Even if it's just a basic wordpress. 	That would happen if it became a novel featured on the main page instead of the forums. With the release rate it has, I don't think it will be long before it happens. Maybe once it reaches chapter 100? We can only hope I guess.
You should get a tattoo of just "Rusty" on the remainder of your arm tbh	我不开心。

Out of curiosity, what do you consider "opening up?"	Willing to speak ones mind freely without the fear of offending the other person 
Yes it was, he probably just tryis to farm some clicks to get more attention, hopefully a mod will delete the most right away.	Someone seems to know.
I’d recommend using one of these to find a solid bible teaching church near you: https://www.9marks.org/church-search/ https://founders.org/church-search/	The church we've been visiting is apart of the Acts 29 network. It's also reformed, they preach expositional sermons and observe the Lord's Supper every week. And we like it a lot. They seem to have a real genuine love for the Lord and for people. 
FYI the snap on dustcovers that come with 5.56 Pmags also work on the D-60. 	Yep, they do, they just don't cover the load gate.
1 XRB withdraw??  lol...  sticking with kucoin	0.01 now. 
The return of the Calvert - Dubinsky - Atkinson line. Feels like 2015 again!	Man, I loved that line. There was a period that year where I couldn't fathom splitting Calvert and Atkinson up. To this day I still kind of think of them as a pair.
I just use the serial number that is already printed on the back of the card. Sure the text is small but it’s already labeled with a unique identifier so I just use that. 	Nice, I'm going to do this. I was about to go full label maker.
I have a 1080 Ti and wondering what I can get.	I max out at 650 kh/s with a TI at 80 PL
What is this style called? https://imgur.com/a/uzFId Kinda the modern hippy. Also what pieces would qualify for this style and where would be the best place to get them? Making a student film and need a few cast members to dress similarly. Much appreciated. 	Look for popovers, loose button downs in linen or linen blends.  Canvas and hemp clothing are your friend. Burlap if you are going all in.
No one is going to comment about how he's driving on the wrong side of the road? OK, I'll do it. He's on the wrong side of the road. 	Could be a brit in an imported car.
My $800 eth order got filled. I was so excited until I saw it went down to 770. Did I get a good deal?	You set a buy order for 800 but are surprised that it went lower? What, you expect it to execute and then bounce directly off?
No. By the way,the sneak peek said her W actually stealthed the teammates but it got changed a few days before the champ got released. 	No kidding?   Didn't know that, that's cool. 
There's no link here... 	[Found it.](https://youtu.be/TVsG1ii4kxs) Come on OP, you had one job! Wow, that intro is... something... 0:34 "The color version." It's been in color since 1970, but I guess I can excuse OP cause they're a new fan.
Wow. Looking cool, Joker!	Looking cool,Dio!

There are several thousand of that type of SCP, they're called katanas	The containment procedure is to leave them be because the problem usually contains itself.
Sources have told David Webb the same thing.  He mentioned it on Lou Dobbs.	You mean Jason Bourne.
They probably would have announced any changes to the pools in the FEH channel if they had any such thing planned. I agree they could do some cleaning, but I highly doubt that they would make T20 easier.	I feel blessed in that Reinhardt is so easy to get and he's also my favourite mage. Still haven't gotten a +Atk version of him, yet though.
She kept your favorite sheets.	No, I had plain tan sheets with no decoration. She's a better room prepper

Still working?????	A friend tried it 20 minutes ago and yes!
Polaroid film. *snap* That'll be £2 please.	Sometimes people sell off expired film at a discounted price, and it still works fine. Taobao has some going for cheaper too. I think just having an immediate, physical copy of a photo makes it worth the price (especially when it's for a special occasion, like a birthday). 
Computer architecture a quantitative approach *6th edition* $20	I have, [*PM Me Here*](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=myelib&amp;subject=Buy%20etextbook) to buy.

Heli pilot, and don't know what to do next	I almost didn't answer this, but I'm an airplane pilot and flight instructor.  What do  you mean, "don't know what to do next"?  Are you looking for a different career? 
Looking at KBB (why doesn't NADA guides have car values anymore?), this car is worth $22.5k. Nothing he listed in mods looks like it is worth $4k to me. I can tell he doesn't take care of the car because not only did he not read how to install his sub, he hasn't even bothered to spend the 65 dollars or whatever to reset that code.	He's in school. Likely broke and all his mods are birthday/Christmas gifts from the well-off parents.
Since your question hasn't really been answered, I asked my dealer this exact question not too long ago. Basically, it doesn't void your warranty... but if something happens that appears to be related to the aftermarket lift, it won't be covered.  (think suspension, etc) Give some of the dealers a call that sell lifted Crosstreks, I'm curious what they say. I imagine it's covered by them since they do it though. 	That’s exactly what I figured would be the case. I am going to make some calls. 
District 9.	I wish i could give you more than one upvote for this
House of wax is similar to those, I haven’t seen the original but the remake is worth a watch. 	I've seen House of wax and really enjoyed that too
It's Windows cocktail.	It gives a really unprofessional feeling when there are a bunch of inconsistency like this. I mean - don't the developers/designers/whatever go through what to do step by step, finish it and then move on the next part instead of jumping around all the time?
The whole album is gold. I've tried to pick a favorite song and I just can't.	Steve Hillage just rocks!
Buy a flavour card make any cigarettes menthol 2 bucks 	Yes.  Itsa flavour cards.  Mint Chill.   They sell them at Circle K.
Are you guys happy now. You traded dbz for this.	In all fairness, the mods must have predicted this episode of DBS, because it's incredibly rant worthy.
Yes! Girls will have the guy saved under "Don't Answer" yet don't have him blocked? Obviously you love being chased. But don't out yourself like that. 	More like  "don't answer unless you need to mooch from him."
They did the same for the Watch for a limited time. Gurman takes a wild guess here. He knows Apple usually does this. Employees get 25% off of everything. And every three years they additionally get $500 off of Macs and $250 off of iPhones, but only after they've been with the company for 90 days.	They also did it for the original iPod. $199 I was a little less insane an amount to spend on a music player. But then the world fell in love…

You’d be surprised by how many people are still dedicated to Benoit.	There are a lot of Benoit apologists on this sub
No idea if it landed on the interstate or not but I once lost a shoe while skydiving. First thought was "so that's how single shoes get on the side of the road".	I put this as a shower thought like a year ago and a couple people shut me down and said it  unlikely :( 
Lifetime earnings I believe :)	Correct. So spend away... you wont get anything you want anyway, if your luck is anything like mine :'(
They’re trying to make you quit	That’s what I figured, my only thought is why waste so much time on losing instead of trying to come back?
Tbh guys I think people have bots set up to auto buy. 	When it's an instant $100+ profit, I wouldn't be surprised at all.

Pulling out is useless, no idea why you do that. Pre-ejaculation can already make someone pregnant. And she is on bc so... 	Maybe it makes clean up easier for her?
Raymond Bourque	I remember him raising the cup such a great emotional moment in hockey history 
Cooper Union?	Clearly.
The ranked and casual matchmaking is global. You're only limited to people in your lobby for Ring and Arena matches. It's still pretty janky in some ways though.	Honestly Rings should be global. It’s hard to fill a lobby, without lag, and play with friends 
It was good.  Not what I expected for a halftime show.  Did not like the Prince part.  Kinda odd and didn’t really belong.  	Prince was from Minneapolis, that’s why it fit.

Anyone else think when the husband was texting his friend asking to use his shelter that he would end up in the shelter from 10 cloverfield lane?	I'm pretty sure it is; they are in the part of the bunker Goodman couldn't get to (when she went through the air vents). The ladder up looks identical.
I'm sitting here drinking, feeling a little jealous, but also happy the Eagles finally got one. I just really hope I'm not 90 when the Vikes finally win one. I wanna still be young enough to burn down a part of my city. 	Hey! You can still burn it down at 90. You... just might end up burning yourself down with it. 
How did you do these moves?	It's just a heavy feinted into all-block repeatedly 
It's like those world championships are confusingly local.	If you would like to field a rest of world team, we can let them play the Eagles. 
Is there a way I can remove the glamour messages from a log? Just to make switching plates more seamless.	It's somewhere in the character settings under log filter.
There are only two genders, correct?	You have a nice sense of humor 
Yes!!! NDV 🦋🔆💛 this stuff might seem small but man is it huge!  I will gladly not drink with you today because I value awareness too 	Thank you. I see the time you invest here and appreciate you. Doing good, hope you're feeling good @ 60 days :)

Catch yourself and change your thinking. ✌	I appreciate this comment. My therapist has me working on "change the way you talk to yourself in your head." Spot on comment!
He already has a nickname. It's Adam Schiff face. Or just Schiff face.	I like Schiff for brains.
Did I write this? Anyway I’m on a bus right now taking some clarity, I’ve started writing more because I’ve felt like I’m not getting to the root of my sadness and I’ll always be sad because of it. I hope you find something that makes the load easier/ worthwhile. Sometimes life is just working until you get to a point where it’s okay to be stagnant. 	Thank you, I hope you do too. 
Other than Karlsson, who else is a reasonable defenceman Tampa may get? Do y'all think McDonagh is too far off?	Hjalmersson 
Nice finish! Looks like your opponent didn't expect that kneebar to come on as quickly as it did.	Thank you! It was a split second decision because I did not want the reset.. 
Got mine in Franklin last week. Passed on the droid	Every time I see your ID I think you are TMash from Cars and Coffee
Kurt has gotten quite bad at speaking. 	He’s not speaking from the heart
You mean the whole "get pregnant, be exempt from PT tests for a year or so while you rack up 8 million hours of volunteer work for those sweet, sweet quarterly/annual awards that matter so much more than your job performance, then get on a few profiles for another year until you absolutely can't skate being fat any longer then get pregnant again and repeat" is gonna go away?	But meh sexism if you bring up anything about women having an easy time. 
Austin sales dogs at thrift stores for $15? Too hip for me.	This one was slightly defective.

Just out of curiosity....how much are most of you down?? &lt;$1k? $1k-10k? $10-50k? 50k+?	I was up $10k from my initial investment three weeks ago, now I'm down $2k... really regretting not selling
Sergachev should be downright embarrassed 	No he shouldn't. He's a rookie against an Art Ross winner. Mistakes happen, whoever put that pass on his tape should feel worse.
Honestly, thinking about eye contact is troubling because it is definitely an instinctual thing. However if you are worried about your eye contact here is how you can tell if its too much or too little: too much means you stare solely at their eyes. Our eyes tend to drift naturally to their other facial features and our surroundings. If you keep your eyes on theirs for the entirety of the conversation, its bound to make them uncomfortable. Too little means no eye contact at all, or flickering your eyes away as soon as you lock eyes. Try not to think about it too much, if you do that then you will fidget and look weird. Dont worry about it!	Thank you for the advice!

Save yourself some money and just put out for some wireless headphones. I've got these and they work great, last 12.5 hours, and sound great. https://www.amazon.com/Anker-SoundBuds-Headphones-Waterproof-Sweatproof/dp/B0721MP41Q 	I have Bluetooth headphones and I totally agree that they're a bunch better. I accidentally forgot them one day and I thought I'd be fine as I have wired headphones as backup in my bag... You can see why this post came up.
&gt; Well. Tell me why the USA isn’t the best country in the world. I’m curious what your rationale is and honestly I will respect your opinion. Thanks. Ridiculous, but not that dramatic.	[_/me stands and puts my hand on my heart for my own new flair_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy6AOGRsR80)
I'm not sure I understand. How does the dog equal 5 days of of food and water?	You eat the dog of course. 
What do you do for a living that requires so many monitors	If he still plays Eve. I know exactly why he has that many monitors/tablets
An anagram for Texas Rangers is Strangers Axe....I just thought that was cool. Edit: also *boooooo you stink*	[MFW another anagram enthusiast](http://i.imgur.com/VF2Sddp.gif)
I notice that the cones have some tiny "scuffs". Are they normal?	The paper of the cones is not smooth and regular as it would be with other materials. If you upload a picture of the scuffs it'd be easier to tell though. 
Just ask him. There was a stuffed dinosaur I saw at Walmart that I liked so I told him. Boom. 	Weird taste in presents, but good advice so I'm still upvoting
Wow awesome job!	Thanks!
I think this is a bad idea. The more we complain about it, the more he will keep it.	Yeah. Whatever people say he is, that’s what he’s not. 
Where's this from? I feel like I've missed something big.	It’s not just big but long too
Kubrick's **2001: A Space Odyssey**. Lester's **The Three Musketeers**. Frankenheimer's **Seven Days in May**. Radford's **Nineteen Eighty-Four**. Lucas' **THX 1138**. Aronofsky's **Pi**.	Pi is a very nice one, I would never have thought about it. I doubt that we will reach 1138 though

Well every single suggestion provided you've said you don't have so at this point just eat it. 	Maxxing limber is the only option to do. I guess. Just dumb luck with champions. 
is there a tougher game to watch as a fan than one in which you just can never quite get in striking distance?	No, it's the one where you're getting blown out and you make a run to get within like 6 or 8 and then someone starts getting hot on the other team and they pad their lead again. well that's sort of what this game is actually
It doesn’t look like anything to me.  	Looks like wooden planks if you ask me.
The insufficient funds happened to me while I was withdrawing. after I refreshed the page, My BTC was gone. I listed a post before and somehow it got deleted. pictures here is a screenshot of the link that got deleted. https://imgur.com/cMQpgZF	No email, no confirmation, nothing? It just disappeared? IIRC the balance shouldn't disappear until after you click the email confirmation, right?
I thought so too when I came back to HS after a long break, it's certainly bracing. But I came around, dusted what I had from old expansions and now play Standard with the cards from last 3 only. Looking forward to next rotation! What DK did you get from playing single player adventure btw?	I got the paladin DK. I thought he would be strong but its probably around average. I'd wager its better than the shaman dk though
You woulnd be holding ICX, NEO and XEM right? So many other good projects up way higher.	ICX and NEO yes, XEN not. They are the top ones in the top 10 ?
I used to have February when I was younger.	I had one kinda like it, it was a teal van or something
I've never tried it, but I've always wanted to buy a girl mozzarella sticks at a bar instead of a drink a la 30 Rock.	Yes please.
The only Uchiha members we really get to see in this series are Madara, Itachi, and Sasuke. Madara and Itachi have no need to copy techniques because when they are introduced they already have OP jutsus. Sasuke eventually becomes OP but when he's a kid we do see him use the copying ability to learn Rock Lee's taijutsu.	Didn't Itachi copy one of Kabuto's jutsu when he and sasuke were fighting him?
Rinea and Alm, and the missing two Berkut and Celica? I can dream...	Please I hope
Kind of weird to have a military parade led by a guy who's never served in the military.	He's not leading it... it's in his honor. 
Imma just leave [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;persist_app=1&amp;noapp=1&amp;v=wge7JK0JV0Q) here as a warning.	I have somehow never seen that.  Amazing.
What is meta?	I’m also confused by this word. 
Cleveland, OH. It's.... regretful	I'll reply with Mansfield, OH here, since it's probably the closest I'll see haha
Time zone for context?	would be UK/EUW
RT never really interested me but is it possible to made 100% for a movie? And is all marvel movies going to have 92 or 97.	Possible but unlikely, early reviews for blockbusters tend to be better than later reviews. Based on past MCU movies, I would guess this will end up in the low 90s. 
Theres a reset buttun on the back of the controller. Push that with a pin or something small enough to fit and hold it down for 10 seconds then release. Try it?	Just tried it. Same issue. Either controller can still wake the console but it still asks me to press the home button to use 
I’ve thought the same thing. I thought about buying Orbs when they release their token. If Orbs can handle the volume generated by KIN wow, everyone will be using it. 	All in on Kin, then Orbs!

2k down shouldn’t make a $100 difference in your monthly payment. Someone correct me if I’m wrong but the math doesn’t make sense	They were really trying to get me to leave with the car, of course, so it was probably something they came up with that might be close? I don't know but I didn't have them run my credit this time but will if I make the next step. 
That hood better be the ballinest most high res 60 fps hood known to man. 	At least as good as their pizza
Got a DOD Boneshaker with the original box. This thing sounds great. I hear it sounds gnarly with bass guitar. I'm interested in other distortions/fuzz pedals! But I'm open to anything. 	Sd1?
They should announce when the EX invitations are going to roll out. Some people raid consistently in hopes to get an invite only to fail getting one because for some reason the very same week they stopped raiding is the one that counts for the invitations. By knowing when a EX wave is coming people will be able to better prepare for it.	I mean, it was pretty much every week. Also that would just cause people to stop raiding one week and go HAM another week.
"It appears this man somehow attempted to drive a car to Mars."	I heard that sentence in my mind in a Vulcan voice. 
This was my favourite episode of League of Gentlemen	Can I have some of your special stuff?
Imagine if the edible you ingested kicked in right then.	We can't stop here?! This is *dog* country!
Got a job doing tech work for the school a week after I graduated. I was walking back to my office while class was in session and a substitute teacher stops me and asks where my hall pass was. I respond by showing him my admin walkie talkie and my keys, explaining that I'm an employee but I don't have an ID badge yet. He gives me the stink eye, and ushers me to the front office despite my exasperated protests, and gets halfway through writing a discipline referral while I sit in my new boss's office (principal) waiting for my 'punishment'. Boss walks in, figures out what's going on, and gives the guy a 5 minute lecture about listening to what people are saying. Guy goes back to class dejected and boss and I shared a good laugh. 	I feel like I would say something like "Go ahead" then go back to what I was doing when the Sub was talking about going to the front office
So can I fuse Sig and Xiong Fei and craft myself up a Perna and Molong? 	They could make it so that you have to fuse 3 Sigs/3 Xiongs for one nat 5 trade.
Most speedrunners are autistic.	I am highly autistic and i love speedrunning
Turian Reaper, Mass Effect?	I was thinking its a cross between cybermen from doctor who and the X01 armour from fallout.
Every update on PS4 so far has been Axi S2 I've yet to see a single Axi L1 in the pool on the bounty board. 	Same here 
He should buy a hat 	I'm sure POTUS has one he can borrow. 🤣🤣
Barca getting Coq-blocked	Nope, we're just sloppy.
I've been sad for the past month.  I haven't figured out a way to hear the new episodes since 124.  Where can I go since there seems to be an issue with the podomatic links? On the plus side....This has given me the kick in the pants needed to listen to the earlier episodes.  	Just add this to your podcatcher, of bookmark it like I do and manually download it http://feeds.feedburner.com/puzzlewarriors3
Back when macbook pros were thicc I dropped mine (accidentally) a ton, and it worked fine. I knew a girl who poured a bottle of maple syrup down her keyboard on a macbook pro (pre-retina) and it still worked (except the bottom left quarter of the keyboard was mostly bonded together with liquid sugar).	Why???
Try the Cesium app.  It’s everything I ever wanted back about the Music app.	I’m a big fan of Plum. It makes the “now playing” screen pretty again. 
At some point JV 3's won't deserve its own post because of how common it is now	That's what I said on one of my posts last game, but raps fans told me to keep posting, so that's what they're gonna get.
I'm definitely interested, is there a league fee? If so how much and what are the payouts?	It's free. Money dynasty leagues don't tend to last. No payouts.
Never happen.  Separation of powers and all that.	Nah nah nah my friend. If Roberts was blackmailed this would be a great time to say it. Bam.
if i was vegan id want to cut myself too i mean i already cut myself, but you know, id probably do it more or something idk	Lol same but everything makes me wanna cut myself
Just wait til next year when we have an entirely new set of freshman who dont have the stamina to play 35+ minutes! And no defensive hustle! And no chemistry! Youll be sorry then! 	wish I could upvote more than once
On the bright side, by the time you get Ivara you won't need her for spy cuz you'll have memorized all the vaults :P	This is very true. She's probably my least favorite spy frame since i'm tempted to use Prowl instead of spoiler mode and its way slower. She's tons of fun for huge brawls with enemy hordes, though.
Who is this?!	It's me! ♥️ r/ceelcee
I'm not a fan of Marisa as a person (it's all just too much chatterbox), but her strategic game is on point. She is a super fan. 	I think she's in the best position right now. In an alliance, talks game, but isn't overplaying or seen as a threat.
Why does she always look mildly frightened?	Must have been imprinted on her after acting in Stranger Things. Always scared, worried...
Lol he could've burned the camera. 	as if he would care about that. He could buy the person holding the camera.
This is looking suspiciously like there's news about to break, and one or two know what it is already.	The price prediction chart for XRP said from Feb 8 - 28th that XRP could hit $16 but we will see. Alibaba needs to find a way to buy out Moneygram 
This is how the villain in "incredibles"  was conceived, cast out by his childhood hero	Godammit get a million nerds washed and powdered and then sent to hug him.  Stat!

Zeah later Mod Reach	Zeah probably would've been better than this if Reach actually designed it before he was let go. This work was mostly from Mod Alfred who took over this project.
This is pretty old news (enacted in 2010). What's up with a moderator posting it with no context or comment?	Probably because it's obviously not enforced.
Can we decrease the block size limit yet? At least temporarily? Let's try 750k for one week sometime this summer?	Why is there an imperative to do this, what's there to gain from decreasing the block size? Genuinely curious?
The fast and the furious movies	The FF movies are so great
I dont know how other tall people feel about this one but hugging is awkward for me. Do I go over the top with the arms? Bend down and get on their level? Give them a one arm side hug? I still don't know.	I dated a short girl once and I had to get on my knees just to hug her
It's definitely canon. So there are two versions of episode 23.  Episode 23β is the version made after the original broadcast of the show, and sets up for Steins;Gate 0.  The timeline has you watch up to 22, then 23β, then S;G 0, then 23 and finish the series.	Thanks. 
Marcus Davenport just seems like a 2nd rounder when I see him play.	This DE class is pretty bad at the top normally I agree but his traits will put him in round one with the lack of other talent.

Who's up? 	Ok now what?!
Loved the movie but a 150 million budget for a slowly paced thought provoking sci fi drama probably wasn't the wisest financial  decision.	But I'm glad they did it. 
His name is Robert Paulson. 	His name? Albert Einstein
How did you get it to change??	There was an update that started downloading by itself when I opened the app yesterday, when I checked the prices after that they had changed 
[[Grinning Ignus]] is a weird card, that's for sure, definitely worthwhile looking for ways to break it. Have you played with this deck online much? How did games play out against established decks like Delver, tron and affinity? If you can get grinning Ignus to generate mana, do you think it's possible to use this deck to [[kaervek's torch]] your opponent for 20 as an alternative win con to [[impact tremors]]? Also, as you are playing blue, playing 4 x [[preordain]] main deck would really help assemble your combo  (maybe moving some of the [[dispels]] to the side and cutting some of the creatures which don't contribute to the combo??) It's a cool first draft of the brew though - excited to see where it goes and hear about your playtesting!	#####&amp;#009; ######&amp;#009; ####&amp;#009; [Grinning Ignus](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/en/mma/118.jpg?1517813031) - [(G)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning%20Ignus) [(SF)](https://scryfall.com/card/mma/118?utm_source=mtgcardfetcher) [(MC)](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Grinning%20Ignus) [kaervek's torch](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/en/vma/175.jpg?1517813031) - [(G)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=kaervek%27s%20torch) [(SF)](https://scryfall.com/card/vma/175?utm_source=mtgcardfetcher) [(MC)](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!kaervek%27s%20torch) [impact tremors](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/en/dtk/140.jpg?1517813031) - [(G)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=impact%20tremors) [(SF)](https://scryfall.com/card/dtk/140?utm_source=mtgcardfetcher) [(MC)](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!impact%20tremors) [preordain](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/en/c15/101.jpg?1517813031) - [(G)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=preordain) [(SF)](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/101?utm_source=mtgcardfetcher) [(MC)](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!preordain) [dispels](https://img.scryfall.com/cards/normal/en/bfz/76.jpg?1517813031) - [(G)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) [(SF)](https://scryfall.com/card/bfz/76?utm_source=mtgcardfetcher) [(MC)](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Dispel) ^^^[[cardname]] ^^^or ^^^[[cardname|SET]] ^^^to ^^^call

Zoho Mail is free for like 10 mailboxes I think, and they have a import wizard to bring mail over from an IMAP account. I have used that before to bring mail over from a cPanel based hosting account's mail. So then you would have the MX records on your domain name to use zoho, and then A record or cname record to point to github's servers.   (both sites have instructions on doing it)	+1 Frood knows where his towels at!

&gt; One thing I constantly worry about is being able to find a job out of college. Do you think you would worry less about this if you were an English major? Art history major? Philosophy? With which major would you worry less about this?	Not any specific major, but just college in general. 
Ur so lucky for rolling Cytopian Horror.	Yeah, perfect card to stop his bow swing next turn xD
That all depends if you have another cm around the same level as petit, if not then it might not then you have to upgrade even more to reach 1051. That is the total rating you need to get maldini, add up all your ratings and divide by 11	Nah... Only Paulinho and Nainggolan both 94 
You're a poster boy candidate for TRT with those levels. Please hop the juice ASAP, it'll change your life	Somtimes it won't, though.  Didn't change much for me.
Oooh lmk when it's up	Upvoted, please return

Use a decent backup tool like Macrium Reflect Free. See this great tutorial https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/61026-backup-restore-macrium-reflect.html	So if I wanna do a full backup after a fresh install and my regular apps installed, I can do this so I can restore everything next time from the backup from USB?

"Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) has until Thursday to review the new Republican-drawn map. If Wolf rejects it, the Supreme Court will instruct independent redistricting expert Nathaniel Persily of Stanford University to draw a new map from scratch." And there is your likely outcome.	The goal is to get the Supreme Court to do it, then complain that it's partisan and try to impeach them. Give it two weeks. 
and loose some of their base... no thank you. 	Lose*
Yes it is, 11 wins is now enough to qualify.	On PC too ?
This is kind of a tricky question to structure. I nicknamed my Pikachu with an expletive.  PikaF.  You can fill in the blank. I wasn't planning to transfer it over to any other game, but I was curious if I'd be able to do that or if it would be caught by a filter and rejected.	It won't be rejected if you, say, transfer through Bank. The name will be removed and replaced by the Species name once it's transferred. So once it goes through, it'll just be called Pikachu.
Cmon man. Let’s not trash talk other teams. We shouldn’t be worried about them. Edit: actually nvm I just saw that other post.	What other post?

I just don't see us making the  Valentine one as it ends today. The other one ends on the 18th.	Let's say that there are  6000 entries and each one has been retweeted at least once, I think we're good.

Let me guess, you're also morally opposed to calling Scythe of Vyse "sheep stick". 	Yeah, that's what moral means.
Was wondering for the two switches, MX Browns or Clears, will there be significant difference? And will I get hand fatigue using the mx clears? I'm currently using the razer tactile switches, and feel like I'm bottoming out a lot. Would I be better suited for Reds/Blacks? 	Clears bottom out at ~90g, they're heavy. Browns bottom out just under 60g

A recruiter I contacted late last week said that they would get back to me at the end of the day and never did.

I wanted to circle back to our conversation last [whatever day] and see if you had any [updates? status? whatever you're talking about]. &gt; &gt; Thanks, have a great day, &gt; &gt; (Your name)
Fun fact: While on Earth Lapis took the time to wear other outfits. She would often fly to other towns while Peridot was busy engaging in "Peridot time", wearing the same outfit she wore during the baseball game with the Rubies. Being a Gem, Lapis is naturally attractive, and many people would ask her out on dates. Lapis would always agree, designate a time to show up, and would show up for about half the date before getting up, walking out on the person, and flying away without saying a word. In Ocean City, Lapis has earned the name "The blue heart", because that's how she makes people feel when she ups and leaves.	Half a date with Lapis? Still worth it, if you ask me.
Maybe I don't get it? This is very similar to how the show is when Ria is on it. Talking bulges and skating fashion but it seems much more listenable. 	Giving a 20 year old girl with no life experiences is not interesting radio
warisboring.com is a respected website. But every serious article about WW2/Hitler which is using plain wrong spelling like "fuhrer" instead of "Führer" makes me wonder with how much care for correct details it was created.	Yea you’re right. I usually read their website just because they have interesting articles from time to time
but does it feature dante from dantes inferno ? or a funky mode ?	no, but it has knuckles
How do you swap skins mid game? I don't see the UI for it.	Yeah I'm pretty sure on pc u can't change skins mid game, or I'm assuming u might be able to do it by pressing H as if u were changing heroes but instead u keep on Mercy and choose the skin u would like to wear.
If it's short notice sure, but I don't think champions should be allowed to turn down fights. You're the champ. Defend or vacate	I agree to a point, unless they are trying to jump somebody up who he doesn't think deserves it.  He said he will Fight RDA if they ask so he is wants to defend against the number one contender instead of against a less deserving fighter. 
So in the time it took her to get ready for her day she consumed 4 meals. Did we find the social media of a hobbit?	Ding ding ding! I think we did!
Maybe it is trendy but it kinda helps tell the boys from the girls since they are all wearing the same thing. I wonder if that plays into their hair flair choice?	That’s what I was thinking. Thanks! 
Nothing.	Could you elaborate? I meant from an attraction point of view.
Looks like a cool map! A few things I'll let you know though about your submission: the submission guidelines advise you don't use titles that include common map title words such as mine, craft, cube, pixel, etc. So you might want to re-title your map. Also, the realms category is probably "adventure" or "experience" (I don't know because I haven't tried the map yet. How does the island generation work? That sounds like a really cool feature, just curious about that. 	We're thinking of a new name, thanks for the feedback! Island generation is just functions and structure blocks, you would have to ask THEGamingninja about it because he did most of the actual commands for the map.

Ah, Jeff Ruland, there's a name that I've never heard before.	he only had 30 games played the season he averaged this but if i have cousins might as well keep this guy lol
They aren’t even doing it right	thatsthejoke.jpg
They should not have the games at Nissan Stadium. Keep them at First Tennessee Park. I would rather have 10 games at sold out packed to capacity madness in a smaller venue then a huge stadium one tenth of the way full.	I totally agree. But I think they are moving it to Nissan because of scheduling conflicts with Sounder's home games and SportsFest is happening on Mar. 24th. 
My new goal is to get my average to 200, since I already bowl a consistent 175 most of the time.	Right there with you...threw a 618 tonight was pumped, but way too many opens.  20 strikes in 3 games, should be bowling better.  Gotta stop missing 1 pin strikes 
I mean, this is a godly rarity, SS!	Super Super? Super Saiyan? Silly Sausage? Who knows!

EPA assumes 21.2 mph average speed for  "city mpg". If you're stop and go traffic results in an average less then that your mileage will be worse.	I would say traffic is pretty free flowing in the areas where I drive. It's not a highway, but on good days I stop at a couple of intersections. I would assume NYC gridlock would result in horrible MPG, but traffic is honestly not that bad in Vancouver...
Is that kacl booth or a bedroom?	That's KACL (booth and corridor).

I am so sorry. I would be devastated to say to my partner 'I am willing to work with the things you cannot change about yourself because I love you' and have them turn around and say they cannot do the same. Big hugs to you, if you'd like them.	thank you. i was completely caught off guard again with this after spending countless hours researching the HRT the past week. So many changes in so little time that I havn't been able to wrap my head around anything at all and it just keeps getting more complicated.

I went to High School with Michael Phelps. I never talked to him(he was a freshman when I was a Senior) and I remember working for the school newspaper and we did a story on him that was essentially “yeah he’s good, but is he as good as his sister? She ALMOST made the Olympics!” It was insane watching that little kid (he was tiny when I went to school with him) grow into the greatest swimmer of all time. Ironically, we didn’t have a swim team at my school.	Is this Renee?
I can drive the nurburgring in my sleep thanks to Gran Turismo, sure its not the real thing but I know the layout and general speeds of upcoming corners.

&gt; This classification seems arbitrary and based on the premise that food produced industrially has a different nutritional and chemical composition from that produced in the home or by artisans. This is not the case. Yes. Also, perhaps there are confounding variables associated with being poor other than the food that they're forced to purchase?	Highly processed food is more expensive per calorie than grains and vegetables and contains less nutrients to boot.

This is going to be one of those cars Im going to have to see in person to make some sort of determination on looks wise. I have the same problem every time Ford releases a new mustang. Looks terriable in pictures but it grows on you after it's released. The camo mule that's been photographed looks too much like a modded RX8 at this time. If it looks as good as the (or closer to) the concept then I'll have to trade in the STi for one. 	Yeah but when was the last time a concept of something looked like the finished product information model ?

Did she try for it and you avoided it?  Or did you just not make a move?	I didn't make a move, but wanted to. Didn't feel comfortable because there were people around us.

So if Michael is everyone, then Fritz is his own replcacement...? One of several reasons why the Michael is everyone theory makes no sense.	He doesn't need to be seen since he's only going to work at night. So he could just fill in his name, fill out the qualifications, and go to work again.

For fun: *The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress* by Robert Heinlein. One of the main characters is an AI. A pretty easy and fun read but still thought-provoking. For serious: *Idoru* by William Gibson. We spent a whole term analyzing and discussing this novel in one of my humanities classes. It is pure genius. It discusses both AI and transhumanism superbly. Gibson is a cultural and social genius. But you have to put effort into this to reap the rewards. I spent three months on it in class and I feel there is still more to think about.	Sounds like I should hit up the serious and then the fun. Either way I'm writing all these down. 
No because it's not legit	is bitcoin gold legit?

The other side of this is, don't get too mired up on the dollar side of this, especially if you are 'addicted'. By being "frugal," you may be wasting something even more valuable: time. Assess how much time you are spending playing this game, and consider if spending money to reduce the time spent is worth it. Most of the time, you'll find that you're essentially 'working' a couple hours a day in order to save maybe $2. Just spend the $2, have more fun in a more compacted time period, and invest the saved time doing something that helps increase your income.	This comment needs more upvotes.  Just as P2W can be bad, F2P can also be taken to an unhealthy extreme.
this is a guess, but roughly a year (or at least a year) before, /u/TemplarKnight98 any idea?	Yeah, in theory the file should already exist by now. But the IB hasn't uploaded it yet to http://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/assessment-and-exams/exam-schedule/ I guess it will be released very soon.
Fastenal, maybe. Or you could find out what the thread should be and buy a tap from MSC Supply.	We actually have a few fastenal around me. It looks like they're closed on the weekend but their website says they carry the part. I'll have to check them out. Thank you for the suggestion!

Uber driver here: So I don't really understand why people are hesitant to talk to drivers, whether we start a conversation or not. Like, if you have headphones on or you don't respond even after a simple "Hello" that's one thing. But most of the time you are in a stranger's car for minutes on end getting to your destination. Is awkward silence REALLY what you want in a stranger's car?	Yes, i want to silently browse my phone instead of forced polite conversation
Take a breath and calm down. Don't tell him he's off. Tell him left, up, a little more left, bingo. Or reach down and guide it in. And don't get frustrated. That won't help anything.	Thank you , Your right I know I have to watch my reactions because that throws him off too I can imagine.

Does it have spark? Is it pumping fuel to the carb? Unplug one of the plug wires from the plug and hold it near metal to see if it sparks when the key is turned to "start". If there is no spark, do the same with the coil wire. If there's no spark from the coil, make sure the battery and ground wire to the coil are connected correctly. If they are, then your coil is bad. If spark isn't the issue, unhook the fuel line from the carb and turn the engine over to see if your fuel pump is working.	Thank you! I didn't get a chance to check spark today, but I'll check tomorrow. The coil is a great idea I didn't think of yet. I do know the fuel pump works, I've checked that one.

Honestly I would probably recommend you stick around this sub and make an effort to answer every asked question. Even go as far as making your own script based around whatever problem is presented. You'll get a lot further invyour learning if you can figure out how to teach it as well. I've often found that I don't know something very well until I try to explain and teach it to others. It tends to make you go the extra mile for practice and research so that you really get to know the subject.	Almost everything seems to be related to Active Directory though.

So I haven't played this game for a decent amount of time, however I know there used to be bots at every level to make up for the few amount of players in the queue pool. I imagine this is still the case, however I've recently tried to get a match and queued for a solid 3 minutes before not queuing with anyone and just giving up. Though I'm at 1600 rank point diddly-doos. I can't give a definitive answer but hopefully this helps.	Thanks! :) 
I always smile when I have more nuggets because I hoped this happened. What's the odds on this being accidental when you receive extra? Is it easy to mess up?	Could be if someone's not paying attention, or if it's the end of the batch and there's not enough for a full portion, you'll get whatever's left. 
What's the interest rate on your student loans? I would put together a 1-2 month emergency fund first if it's above 5-6%, then pay off the student loans. If it's 4-5%, I would build up 3-6 months in your emergency fund first. If it's under 4% (unlikely, but hey) then I would just pay the minimum forever unless you decide to go completely debt-free.	The loan is at 5.5%. I think I'm just going to have to do some modeling to figure out the optimum here.
The answer is a resounding YES. Ask for a meeting with your manager and break the news to him while he's sitting. Ask if your company can grant an accommodation for your condition, and make sure he's not feeling insecure about what he's hearing. Ask him this directly. In these circumstances, I'd also recommend getting to his office first and sitting in his chair while breaking the news. Have him sit where staff normally would. You *are* the smarter one, after all. Explain that to him.	Be sure to have an HR rep during the meeting to retroactively renegotiate your salary now they know your worth. Get slip in a penalty for them not recognizing it first.

It's just a matter of how the formats developed. AAC wasn't early enough to have the momentum/ubiquity of mp3 and isn't *good enough* to be the *informed* choice in 2018. So it's lost in the middle.

Thanks for the replies guys! I’ve been eyeing a career in intelligence for the last couple of semesters now. I don’t have any military background but doing some research I’ve discovered that quite a few analysts have been hired with no military background and holding just a bachelors degree. I don’t really know if this is the norm or not. I’m fluent in Arabic and figured that a in demand language such as Arabic would really look good on my resume. I’m going to be applying for some internships with some of the three letter agencies really soon so maybe that will help get my foot in the door. I just really wanted to know if my age (35) would work against me? Or do these agencies hire analysts at any age as long as they have the credentials and obtain a security clearance. Thanks guys	Arabic is a key skill you left out.  Have you checked out their internship programs?

The logo is not a snake, it is an [Ouroboros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) I think that Reileen hid Quellcrist's backup inside of Tak. I think that is why he can see and talk to her as if she were in the room. 	I don't think Rei would hide Quell's backup inside Tak. The whole reason she betrayed him was to keep Tak for herself.
And so the great brexit fudge begins. This is going to be a frustrating few years. Remain or leave it's going to be interminable watching this whole pointless mess draw out over the next 10 years.	They voted on a stupid question, they should expect a stupid answer. 
Should have linked the direct source.  Ironically, inquisitir is on the studies list of junk news sites. [Direct link to the study and data.](http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/polarization-partisanship-and-junk-news/)	I don’t know what inquisitir is, and they don’t list junk news sites from what i read but junk news stories instead. Shareblue is among them.
I think that's one of the best post i have seen in a while birader.	Sizler için...
Hope you're keeping the 3D off though. Also I hatched the same scheme on my two younger sisters with animal crossing haha	I never even have the 3D on for myself! 
560s are probably your best bet if they're half the cost. If they were similar I'd do 1050ti's for the simplicity and energy savings, but that's a pretty large price difference.	Yeah but I mean 560s aren’t too much of a headache to set up are they?? 
For those who don't know: https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar Great card, OP. Represents the character perfectly.	What is that story from ? Is it part of one of the un sets? 
Parks and rec (just survive season 1 lol)	Yes parks and rec for suuuuuuure
Something sounds off. Your screams are very "yell-y", and your voice is cracking. Maybe you have too much clean voice there? I'm assuming you're trying to do fry screams? 	I do frys I'm pretty sure at least for higher screams. 
Meta has changed padwan, you underestimated my power!!	Haha no kidding!
Really sweet.	Thanks!
How is the Titan XP compared to the 1080Ti for gaming?	minimally better and generally not worth the price difference
Wow. You might consider posting this to /r/lipsthatgrip	Thanks your the tip, I’ll check it out haha
David Samson has such awful taste in movies. He’s really the worst all-around.	Agreed
Bit of an assumption to say they were passionate about it. Artists don't always get the chance to work on things that actually fulfil them, you can't eat integrity after all.	It puts food on their table, which is what matters at the end of the day.
*sigh* here we go again.......again.....	And again and again and again and again Rumor mill don’t stop so easy
Is Rinea unpopular? She’s definitely a unit I would love to have.	We could have gotten her in fallen heroes :/

Good lighting mods. Honestly when u go into a cave and its actually dark so u have to equip a torch and sacrifice ur shield its one of those things that just adds to the experience. Theres loads and loads that add to that kind of feeling.	😮 That’s exactly what I’m looking for. Any you recommend or just pick the most popular lighting mod?

It's archangels staff being way 2 powerful. I used to have to wait for my 3rd item on anivia to get any CDR and now it's giving 20% an extra 400 mana (damage on ryze) and the build path has easier items to purchase with better stats than just a rod. Now we get these 2 items which takes care of our cdr needs then we can just move right into liandries. Most these items are too strong. Anivia used to be strong mid/late game now I'm getting so many stats so early without having to be conservative with mana so I can skirmish with my jungler. Who would of thought that 1400 mana, about 164 ap with Seraphs and ROA, a shield to stay alive, 25% mana refunded, and 20% CDR was a good idea. So many stats off one item. 	Arcg is now a rush on ryze, with it alone you have something like 1.8k mana by the time you get it with the tear stacking.
What game is this?	https://www.geforce.com/games-applications/pc-applications/faceworks/downloads I just found out nvidia still makes tech demos!  They used to be the best way to try out your newest video card, since they always had features even 3dMark2001, let alone actual games, didn't have.
That is one empty arena...	Every single game thread, lol

WAY TOO MANY. Like more than 20? 30? It is bad. As I always do on these posts I have to recommend Senita leggings. They are the best quality of any leggings I own and 1/4 of the price of my lulu, athleta, etc. leggings. 	I recently discovered this brand. The prices are definitely better than Lulu or athleta! Maybe I’ll try!! 
Could you precise your height ? where to you start (lb) and what's your weight when you start HRT? I'm 46, just starting the process and it's looks like I approx the same shape as you	I am 6'2" and in the left picture I was 340 pounds and got down to 245 before I started HRT.  I've gained some back cause it is a lot harder to lose and/or keep the weight off now!

Getting to the moon is pretty neat	It will be, once they actually do it.
I want a relationship and I'm not already in one so that blows your theory.	Im curious about what defines my league though.
I’d actually like to see the option to take one (or 2) animals from your menagerie and assign them as pets. Catch anything from the whole game to have as let. Would probably interfere with the MTX pet system tho..	Pet transfer mtx

Went out for drinks with a barrister who is clearly a bad influence last night, hopefully it was not too obvious to the client I spent the day with. Now heading out for more drinks, though these ones I can bill to the firm!	Failed to leave at a sensible time on a weeknight? Tsk tsk tsk.

I guess I'll flip a coin between Nobody Can Save Me and Sharp Edges.  Can't really bring myself to vote for the title track.	I'm guessing the coin decided Sharp Edges?

Can someone briefly explain me the legend of king arthur to me? It's really hard to understand what's going on in F/GO's chapter 6 for me.	[Here's a great video on the mythos](https://youtu.be/i_jgF-S746o)
I kinda want to check that place out. How is it?	It's great!  Awesome environment.  Fantastic staff.  Definitely would check it out if you're in the Columbus, OH area!
1st - I want to know where he got X-ray goggles that actually work. 2nd - X-ray goggles that work exist - time to switch to lead underwear.	 The lanyard was sticking out of the pocket that the keys were in, most likely. 
Didn't you buy any of it?	I am a broke college student
Trust in what way? They operate exactly how I expect them to, so I suppose I trust them?	Trust as in they actually care about their players and don’t try to intentionally create problems in the game, only to turn around and try to sell you the solution
I can’t imagine not being able to use my hands and only stuck using my mouth. 	Well their feet sure are more helpful than human feet, and they get to fly!

Love [her tweet from the other day](https://twitter.com/LedeckaEster/status/965635009477533696): &gt;Austria: We are the best in super-G!: &gt;Swiss: No, we are the best! &gt;USA: Shut up, we are the best! &gt;Italia: Mamma mia! &gt;Ledecka: Hold my beer ... and snowboard.	don't think it's actually her account.
Looks good. And it fits with the lore too, a Skitarii Alpha Primus is independent enough to lead without tech-priest supervision. Wish there was an option for one in the codex.	Exactly! Like that Primus in the Priests of Mars series, the one who leads the Skitarii cohort aboard the ship. 
Still have my 10x short from 10.4k open, feeling better every minute. :D	I had a short from 11k, which I closed at 10k, opening a long from there. Dang.

Neoconservatives know that utopia is impossible so...nonexistent 	With enough drones, and enough interventionism, ANYTHING is possible.
When you shake the surface do you hear it? I'm wondering if you somehow broke the chassis or whatever the technical term is called, that houses the card.	Yeah probably this! An SD card won't actually fit flush. It will stick out, so there's no way it goes in further unless you've broken something!

Hygrophila corymbosa, or temple plant. It's super easy to take cuts from and replant to fill out empty spaces in the tank. It also makes for some great cover for fry.	Thank you!! It turns out that it’s Hygrophilia Corymbosa Siamensis

Also, I do plan on getting lasik surgery in the future, but because of my prescription it *starts* at $1799 per eye (at least at the places in my area) so I'll have to get my finances in order before taking that on! 	try out eyebuydirect too. good frames and lenses for cheap
I'm really sorry about that man. What had happened to me before was similar but definately not on the same scale.  You deserve a lot better than that. Someone that truly loves your soul. 	Thanks mate, appreciate your words so much. 
a week after 2/18 would be 2/25. It's 2/24. Plus they changed it to monday snapshot and fsa distro	I thought the change to Monday came with the ERC223 upgrade, which is March 4th (or at least scheduled for then)? Or did I misread something in there. Regardless, you're right, the snapshot wouldn't have happened yet.
There's a second stage?!?! When was this?	Bee Pan dokkans on Jpn, second stage drops her medals 
I set up a nice candle lit dinner at home for gf once. In the middle of dinner she drops that candles remind her of extremely poor family who had to ration their candles into minutes and they had to multitask to conserve light. You had to do your homework all at the same time cuz the candles only lasted so long. Still tears me up	Omg yes! Where I'm from candle light dinners are not considered great. No one pulls out candles for fun. 
If you swim in there is their a chance you'll become a can of vegetables? 	That or a supervillain
Problem is everyones binder full of nat elites... i litterally probably can make 20 badges for under 20k each... prices will never be super high like past maddens when sets dropped. 45k tops probably then back under 35k	They’ve been as high as 50k this year though when they added the motivator, veteran, and FO sets.

Just another example of Liberal Party entitlement run amok.  The election cannot come soon enough to run these miscreants out on a rail.	I don't read it like that. Wanting more stations is good, and I don't buy Barrie riders disusing transit due to wait times. If there are enough trains, and the odd express line, you will be fine. 
Manassas pound for pound best name for a city.	Everybody knows you don’t weigh cities in pounds
Slight inconvenience in almost everything they do. 	Hit all the red lights, delayed flights, always picking the slowest line at the grocery store...

Been good for me. Was 22-8 then lost 2 in a row. Going to play remaining games tomorrow as WL got extended. Hopefully I get gold 1 again and don't bottle it lol would be my second  gold 1 finish. 	Nice man I'm sure you'll be able to get it. Any time I lost two in a row I took a break and would usually come back to a W.

My wife and I met a couple who had just decided to take a 6 month hiatus, and we were very on the edge at that point and decided we would also take a six month hiatus.  All 4 of us resigned not soon after.	Ditto here

Hello guys im pretty new and i wanted to ask something. How do u get the training point ? is the only way by using rare recruits? And also i have a dupe of legend zorro ist it ok to ues is fpr the sabo ship? 	Yeah you can trade in characters such as raid bosses/pulls for Ray Points. Since Zoro already has a 6+ released on JPN and we know it's quite similar to his 6* form, you can trade in your dupe Zoro for 5000 Ray Points
"This idea that Tomi Lahren is a thought leader for conservatives should be humiliating to conservatives.  Tomi Lahren has bragged about not reading books. One of the reasons you need to read books is so that you have a better response to Joe Kennedy than he's a limpdick ginger." -Ben Shapiro 🤔	You also need a better response to people then most of what Shapiro thinks up.
So Dio's face is pure and bangable? 	Yep

&gt;The salary for beginning teachers in West Virginia is $32,435 a year, and the average teacher salary is $44,701, according to the state teachers union. That's pretty low to start after 4 years of school + credentials but isn't the COL lower in WV?  There are houses ranging from 80-250k. LAUSD starts at 55k but the COL is high.	County school superintendents make $280,000/yr.

Fun episode all around. A great mix of humor and spooky stories. 	glad you're enjoying it! I'm looking forward to pt. 2 (week after next - this week is technically our dark week but we'll be releasing an ad-free episode). Prob one of the scariest stories any of us have ever heard.
Don't call the cops. They have bigger things to worry about. The Department of Public Health-Environmental Health Section (SFDPH—EHS) responds to reports of illegally disposed hazardous chemicals and medical waste. Along with DPW, SFDPH—EHS staff will remove improperly disposed needles and ensure the proper disposal. SFDPH—EHS also provide training to other City departments, public agencies, and community groups on how to safely pick up and dispose contaminated syringes. The SFDPH—EHS Hazardous Waste Program can be reached at 415-252-3962.	My dad is an Environmental Health Inspector for the SFDPH and all you have to do is call and they will come out and take care of it. He’s always getting calls for things like paint, pesticides, needles etc.

I traded for him. It was all suppose to be good.. they told me it would be great! Between him and bishop, I am not sure which is more terrible.	Not sure what's going on with goalies. It's nice to know that he's not the only one struggling this year however. And don't get me wrong 27 wins is great. But his peripherals are garbage 
Ok, I love El Cayote, but couldn't Tom spring for a nicer place?	Not until those Tom-Tom checks start rolling in.

"He's at this funeral situation" Really brett, did you just find out the most used 4 syllable word so you can sound smarter?	I lost it when he said "funeral situation" it makes the least sense out of all the situations he said in that video.
Buy in pieces. You may get a better entry point after the ONT airdrop. This is not financial advice. I’ve just learned over time it’s best sometimes to be patient. Maybe buy some now and spread it over the next few days. 	Great suggestion. I'd bet that by March 2-3 the price dips for a week or whatever. 
I have no issues with bridge. The one I did have was resolved quickly. And, why would anyone still use yobit?	I’ve been on yobit for 2 years and have never had a problem...they are still the fastest in withdrawals and deposits.
Did anyone get anything yet?	Nope. Added the token to make sure. I'm a 'smaller wallet' though... only 108 BAR.
Have you seen John Wick?	Haha, I didn’t even think of that for some reason! That would be cool though. 
Well everyone, looks like we're out of cigarettes and coffee.	That is the scariest by far
I started a company selling land mines that look like prayer mats. Prophets are going through the roof.	Real joke is always in the comments 
I just want Bob’s reaction. His reaction to maskgate was priceless. 	OMG LINK ME IVE NEVER SEEN IT
Oakland's current payroll is 59 million. That's less than their payroll in 2004.	And each team got $50 mil from the BAMTech sale, so they are paying $9 million for their team this season.
Agholor. I thought he'd be so bad we should switch him to CB.	Haha. I had a bit of faith in him but it really got solidified when we moved J-Matt (who was one of my favorites)
Thats one heavy beard. 	Dude that's no way to talk about his wife 
Unfortunately, now is a horrible time to buy a desktop. Normally you could easily build a beast of a wow machine for 1200-1300. But due to demand on GPU's to mine crypto currency GPUs are impossible to find and between 2x and 3x normal msrp. A 1070 GPU normally 400 is like 800 dollars right now. If budget is a concern for you, you aren't going to find the results you expect right now due to the GPU crisis. 	Well WoW is heavily CPU bound anyway so
Mine says when you shop the dell store so i don't think its site wide but who knows.	Yep, Dell only. Waste of time. 
Also, Vision swinging Mjolnir. Love it. "It's terribly well balanced."	Well if there's too much weight you lose power on the swing so... 
I'd recommend Personal Capital except it won't link to coinbase currently. If you're okay adding crypto assets manually it could still be a good option for your other accounts, though.	Thanks I’ll check it out. 
My vote for indoor play is still the Rival Nemesis with 3s and 500 round hopper.  You can spray around every corner, destroy everyone you see, and laugh the whole time doing it.  Weakness is long-range outdoor play, but I don't play outdoors anyway.	How much soldering'difficulty is involved? that's my weak point and am working to get better in
You aren't alone. When I go by train, I always turn up an hour ealier then planned and manage to catch an earlier train, so that's a win win for me!	It's not so great if you have an Advance ticket and you can see two or three earlier trains you could have taken if you'd bought a flexible one, though.
Dog eating dogs	The drums in the bridge... 
Okay so they pay it back. Whats the punishment though? Paying it back means they are square, whats the punishment for breaking the law?? System is rigged yo	As others have pointed out. What if the person donating is the one responsible for it not being a legal donation, and the liberal party (genuinely) took it in good faith (because it's impractical to check every donation).
Rejected from Duke/TUNL, which I expected. Only one I've heard from so far. But with the first round deadline approaching I'm not holding my breath lol	That was the one I was rejected from as well. 
You can be called what you want by other people. If you really don't like Jonah, you can just reserve it for "official" documents and let people call you your chosen name. If you do choose a name for yourself, I don't think it's necessary to tell them your real name when introducing yourself.	True, they don’t really need to know my real name. What about schoolwork? Like writing Jim on homework? Would that be okay 
I'm F2P and I accidentally zeta'd Jyn's unique when upgrading her for HRancor. You can imagine my pain. I've tried to build up a decent Rogue One team to double down on the clumsiness of an accidental button press, but still... it's not even her leadership!! Oh, and only 71 shards to go for Baze 😭	From one F2P to another, I’ll tell you a trick to avoid accidental zetas. Never have enough omegas.
Wow, you're a talent! Hair is really hard. This looks great. Awesome lighting and color palette	thank you so much!
When Gary Drayton asks "could it be?" you'd kinda expect the universe to start folding in on itself or something..	Think we can get Dave to say Could it be?

Hey that's by the streets	Yup!
Go ahead and purchase the monitor. It will work just like any other non variable sync monitor. Go in to the OSD (on screen display) menu on the monitor and turn on FreeSync. That will enable the fastest refresh rate. 	Ok. If the default refresh rate is 144, shouldn't I just be able to enable the refresh via the nVidia control panerl at 144?

Did no one notice the guy with the camera is outside his vehicle filming this?  I'm sure we all remember what happened last time someone got out of their car around a tiger...	I don't think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW2-tabKE7E) was the last time, but it's the one I think of (with lions, though).
So who was casting the Genjutsu inside the ice mirrors? Ryogi or the boss? Because it would be cool if it was Ryogi. A good contrast to Haku's ice mirror.	I would have liked it to be Ryogi too, but I think it was the boss. Shikadai warned Boruto not to look in any mirrors when he was leaving the fight with Ryugi, and then Boruto got trapped the same way when he tried to fight the boss. 
Can't sleep, been thinking of her all afternoon until now. I wonder if she ever thought of me as well since..	SAAAAAME
That can't be right. Where are you seeing that? See [fork.lol](https://fork.lol/) for a more likely number.	It's in the thread about segwit adoption. https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions Okay now it's saying 44. Seems like it's getting it's data from really recent blocks and not over a long enough period of time 5o show a true average.
A keezer with a tower? I don't know that I've seen that before, but it looks really good! How do you open it to change out the kegs, etc?	[Here is mine](https://i.imgur.com/PGLhM23.jpg) and yeah, the lid just lifts up. It's on casters so you can roll it away from the wall.

If you are downgrading to a plan with the same amount of disk space or more, you can do that using a resize. There should be two resize options, one that changes the disk space (a "permanent" resize) and one that doesn't (a "flexible" resize). This isn't very intuitive, but when resizing down make sure you select the one that does change disk space. If the plan you want to resize to has less disk space than the one you're currently on, you will need to manually migrate to a new Droplet. You won't be able to resize down due to the potential for data loss. We're working on a better way to shrink Droplets' disks but that's not ready yet. 	Awesome, thank you! I didn't think about checking under Resizing, DOH moment on my part!  If you don't mind me asking here, if I set up a floating IP, does that just basically forward all traffic (the droplet doesn't even know it is responding to that IP?)

Thank you for compiling this! Do you have to go through the entire list before leaving the store? Or can you do that at home then just let them know?	It's best to just do it then and there, but I assume they wouldn't call you a liar if they forgot to include something. Now, when it comes to paint scratches, that might be problematic.
Let W!Tharjas default. Close Counter is her best A skill. Maybe you could give her the CD seal. I heard that Grima with DD and additional DD seal works great, also consider trying it :)	Oh, yeah, I was referring to the CD and DD Seals. Any reason why DD seal over CD seal for him?
Maybe some sort of mechanic that focuses on 'reputation' (for lack of a better word).  You roll into town, you're just some guy who one or two people have heard of due to your work in a previous town.  Maybe you have a religious contact or a letter of introduction to a guild etc.  That gets you one or two quests.  Doing work increases both general reputation (slowly) and a faction/group reputation (faster).  To me, it doesn't even have to have an effect on the rest of the game; but it would also help with the immersion breaking "Hey, I just met you, go find my lost dog/scroll/sword/kid...."	Didn't Fable 2 do this at least to some degree? I remember there being at least a handful of quests that you needed a certain amount of renown to start.

Soldering is the only real technical/, physical skill you need, aside from the general ability to follow directions.  100% absolute most important advice is to practice soldering and get good at it (if you aren't already of course) before you attempt to solder your sound board	I have tried doing it before but that was a long time ago, thank you for the advice

I don't think I'd base my list on the secondary market that heavily. I might look at a few of the most requested reprints, then make a draftable format that is fun to play. This is because I know wizards makes the majority of its money from casual players and not from people buying for EV. Pandering to the wrong demographic would hurt the product overall. Ultimately making a fun set would sell more packs and inevitably make the reprinted cards more accessible to the majority of players. This would feel like a success to me. Just how I would do it. 	Isn’t this what they tried with Iconic Masters (a cool draft environment and ignoring a certain demographic?) Wizards just *apologized* for that set. That’s how poorly it did. Why is this solution different? 
I can confirm that nothing has come in at any of the local Barnes &amp; Noble stores in my area. I was told by one employee that the Saga exclusive will not be in until the 13th. However, I am going to verify this with another store, just to be safe!	Same date they told my dad in Florida

You know, he could have just told his former self how to construct the time machine. Also the paradox is that once he has told himself not to build the time machine he will no longer go back to tell himself to build it, and will therefore build it again only to go back and instruct himself not to.

not an issue i've had personally (though i definitely made progress by doing swan reps &amp;  training 'superman' holds on the ground &amp; their variations eg. legs only/arms only/contra-lateral leg-arm/anchored arms only) but your post reminded me of this video workout routine for the lower back that gets shared a lot between rock climbers https://youtu.be/4BOTvaRaDjI	This is great, thank you! I’m definitely going to start doing this with my daily(ish) workouts and also incorporate some of the moves into my warmup routine. Thanks again!

As stated before, for JavaScript and Web Development FreeCode Camp is amazing. I still can't believe how much content they have for free and how often it is updated. I graduated from a bootcamp before I became a professional developer but I aced the entrance exam and bypassed a month of learning material from the bootcamp just from studying on FreeCode Camp. If you have the discipline to put in enough time and build projects I am 100% confident you could go from no programming experience to a professional developer if you wanted to. The only thing I would add is You-Don't-Know-JS. https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS This free series does such an awesome deep dive into Javascript, I highly recommend it.	How good is FCC for vanilla JS though? I notice they dive into Jquery and Bootsrap fairly early? I don't doubt it is great for straight up web development, but if someone wants to learn vanilla JS in and out first, is FCC still the best recommendation? Thanks.

So is everyone else, let's say atheists allowed to wear hijab like headwear as well? Or do only muslims get special privilege due to their religious beliefs? If that's the case, then that's obviously ridiculous.	If you HAVE to wear something, then you can keep it. This covers religious obligations, health obligations, anything where it is not optional. If you don’t have to, then you can stand to be without it for as long as it takes to be photographed.

I would potentially be interested.  What time would you be doing the initial draft? Most nights I work I'm not home till 9:30pm EST. Also as the other person commented, it would have to go through Discord.	Ya I’m scrapping the groupme part, it’s definitely going to be discord. As far as a draft time goes, that will be discussed, but I think we’re aiming for a weekend night, or maybe even a Saturday or Sunday morning.

I’m blown away the quality of Pixar’s story telling and composition. No words and yet it struck at the very core of a human experience. Just incredibly touching. 	Words are an utterly inadequate way of expressing the full experience of human emotion, and Pixar understands that intimately.

If the 0% interest period extends through graduation, there's no problems, right? No interest or credit score hits, just pay the minimums until July, then pay it off. Otherwise, yeah you could consider a 0% balance transfer card, but you have no income to show yet so not particularly likely to be approved. I mean even in the worst case where its begun accruing interest you're likely looking at 200-400$. This will not hurt your credit score as long as you keep making minimum payments. If you can't make the minimum this month, it should be a small number, what about borrowing from a family member? Side note, mind sharing your area of study/job field after graduation?	They are 21 so they can include income that they have access to, whether it is a parent or significant other.
When I first started the first 2 weeks I just ate 4 times a day and didn't track. I didn't start tracking until I was starting to get into ketosis, then I cut back to 1700.

What training gloves for training do you recommend I'm looking into Cleto Reyes training gloves 	Ringside IMF Tech gloves are my personal favorite but there’s definitely great gloves to be found from Grant, Everlast MX and Winnings. I don’t like Reyes just because they tend to be a little less padded and, for training, I much prefer more weight and more padding than less.
Although there’s the fun I guess. If they just attune or study to it they won’t figure out if it’s curced will they?	Identify itself doesn't automatically reveal curses though, as you can see from the text of "Cursed Items" on page 138/139 of the DMG.

I have quite a few Coltrane monos and the requisite miles davis albums. I’ve amassed a few blue note van geldor... but good jazz records are hard to come by in Seattle. It’s basically Dave Brubeck in every collection I dig through.
Everyday. Its all good. 	Any notcieable effects from adding the CBD to kratom?
"Private key transfers" ... interesting solution to what they see is a problem. Why they don't just use a currency like Digibyte instead of wasting money developing something that's going to be inferior is beyond me. 	because they would likely charge a small fee on that service, so they can stay in the game :p
Seems like they fixed the manual check for update. Clicked it once and got it!!!	Same here.  
Well...im not an expert Id probably run Cell in a cell deck. Ginyu in a ginyu deck and goku in a goku deck. In all honesty, cell is the only one thats used regularly. Ginyu in a ginyu deck with the promo cards is viable but noy recommended. More to the point you would need multiple copies of any SR like these to effectively use them. 	Hi, Money isn't too big of an issue, I've been looking into android/cell decks atm and I think I've got something good (one of the joys of this game is the relatively low cost of cards currently) that would need 3 more PFC's. Thanks :) 
Is rc touring not really a thing anymore? 	I am surprised of how unpopular it is these days. In the early 2000s it was extremely popular. It makes sense since I don't think there's as many tracks around after many hobby shops have closed down.

There are two options when you buy x theme. There is X and Pro. If you only bought X, then you won’t have access to the header and footer builder. You’ll have to buy Pro instead. Also you can’t buy Pro on themeforest, they only sell that on their own website. 	That was it! Thanks
Even if I was interested in this, the name is so terrible it would have immediately put me off.	They were trying for the same vibe as those Hourglass Lip Stylos ("Activist", "Peacemaker", "Achiever") and inspirational quote posters, but ended up sounding like they couldn't decide which YouTuber to collaborate with.
Honestly this part of the game is infuriating, it should be a push pull capture.  If you have more people, you should still be securing the point.	I thought that too when the game first came out. But the objectives are so small I feel like it'd be impossible for defenders to do anything. Attackers could just swarm on top of the objective without actually clearing it.

You can buy/rent a subscription that'll give you dailies that give 20 coins, +50% resources limit and rep gain.

Cause buying a Boost for Rep in a beta is pretty stupid if they Reset when the game officialy launch  
Choose the slowest cart and the heaviest character. That is what I do to try and even the odds	The heaviest character makes your top speed higher. I would say choose the lightest (baby) characters and a kart with low speed.

Was there with the band. Theres no way to explain how much the crowd was a factor in this game.  This was a home game for Charleston. They got loud and stayed loud in the second half and definitely got to our players. Miscommunication, silly mistakes etc. I'm disappointed especially after doing so well in the first half but I'm also proud of how well this team performed this year. 	I thought the band sounded good listening on WRBB. Did arrangements change? Songs sounded fuller.

They simply hacked the Gibson.	They're trashing our rights, trashing the flow of data.
That's a nice hot take, but no it helps him. People are staying away from players like Hayden Hurst and Bo Scarbrough because they are 25 already. Being young, and productive, like Edmunds gives teams 0 reason not to take him. He played 2 full seasons in the ACC, he's got enough experience. 	Scarbough only 21...

There was a phishing website a couple months ago that was identical to Binance, and it even asked for the 2FA and then there must have been a bot that logged in on the actual binance in the backend realtime using the 2fa that the person entered into the phishing site. Once the phishing site/bot was in my buddy's account. It just sat there and refreshed every 10 minutes to not get logged out. My guess is they implanted themselves in hundreds of accounts and now just did this synchronized buy on VIA	If you login from two different locations doesnt it log out out of the first one?
I never used a bot. I am extremely secure, 100% certain I did not get phished. I have had 2FA on since the first day I signed up. I never activated the API key stuff, never generated a single API key. I , do however, use the mobile app, I believe the attacker obtained access through 1 of 3 things: 1. Phished accounts, enabled API himself &amp; saved the key. 2. Obtained API keys through bots 3. Obtained API key somehow hacking the mobile app backend (this is the only feasible way I could have been hacked). I had BTC on there that just got transferred out directly, no alts but I'm sure if I had alts they would have been sold off and then BTC transferred out like the others.

335i by any chance? The N54 engine does tend to go through ignition coils faster than most others engines I know of so your experience wouldn't be too unusual to me.

Whole market is overly cautious and wary, general trend is downwards. If the low price of sumo worries you, keep in mind that the coin is very low marketcap which makes it quite volatile.

I miss the type of Naruto episodes that would get my 10 year old self hyped jumping on the bed in excitement. Boruto is like a plain bagel compared to the full 5 star bread and breakfast that Naruto was.	It might have helped that you were 10, I wonder how kids feel about boruto these days? 
This is easily a DDLC anime ending.	I want a DDLC anime
Fat shaming does work, just not all the time. People are wrong in saying it doesn't work. Is it a particularly moral thing to do? Not in my opinion. There are other tactics that work better and more frequently to help a person lose weight and to do it in a healthier manner.	Fat shaming keeps not fat people from getting fat.  It doesn't make fat people lose weight.
Walmart is skimping on floor cleaning cost, no wonder their stuff are cheap, lol	I'm sure all the people in there don't really help things :P
Remember when MBJ was Cyborg?	He could have been a great Cyborg, but no one could have salvaged the role in JL
under armor? 	Kids don’t think UA is cool anymore, jumped the shark with bad mgmt.
Last week I used custom tactics and player instructions for the first time and got 22 wins, the team feels a lot better so I’m hoping for the best  	Good luck!
[Moral relativism] (https://i.redd.it/vb16qorf3yc01.jpg)	But there are lots of things that are right under some circumstances and wrong under other circumstances.  I use examples of this with my kids all the time, like yelling and running on a practice field is great, but is not appropriate in the classroom.  
Mark Twain was scathing in his criticism at the time.	And Teddy Roosevelt called him a traitor for it too.
It's still there. I've seen it last night. 	Really? I've not seen it since, I was sure they removed it for some strange reason.
Fairly disingenuous when you consider that nearly half our net contribution is via VAT and import duties ('traditional own resources' as the EU terms them)	Why does a bigger percentage of VAT and import duties go to the EU? 
I liked this game a lot.  But it's not near as good as people remember.  	No, I played it on the original Wii last year, and it really, really is. It’s my favorite Zelda game.

The real question is what outfit he will wear. Im voting for Gerudo Vai top, Barbarian Shorts, and Korok Mask	Snowquill armor would be awesome. 
Bro next time just put them through the dish washer. Duh. Edit: for the record, I was kidding 	I wish this thought wasn't my first millisecond thought on the task. 
I advocate for cameras recording you, the driver, at all times. You're going to need them once they start handing out tickets for changing the radio station or climate.	I've been thinking about it, I have a regular dashcam which faces the front but records sounds inside the vehicle - which is great for those traffic stops! - but I think it's time to invest into one with a view inside the vehicle AND a rear view, too.
Full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNP2y7ELus	Ok, I watched it 6 times now. Just 1 more time...
Another thing to note. If the enemy team is flaming each other in all chat, it's almost guaranteed the game is over and is conceded to you. Call this dirty, but I fuel the flames sometimes and start fights between enemy team members. It's not exactly the most morally correct thing I've ever done, but it has won me some games.	Guilty
I think HubSpot templates are the best.	I use them
So why did they move the price of a seasonal skin up to 660 R6 credits?	Because 20 million+ players and you can't buy exactly 660 credits. You could before buy 600 exactly for 5 bucks. That means spending more money with left over credits for something else.

At previous event you had free useless PTG cards from completing the SBC's. As i remember you could have 4 or even 5 cheap PTG cards. I did them all and spring untradeable SBC is super cheap when you can reroll that useless cards. I did 11 already and im out of useless PTG cards. Packed Willian, Thiago, Sterling, Firmino and Icardi. Incredible luck.	I got Damm 4 times in 6 packs....
If you're not modifying the engine. I would highly recommend going with hot reloads instead of restarting the engine all the time. Engine startup can indeed take quite a while. (Edit: There's probably ways to speed it up. Not an expert there. But I usually just compile my game code and let it hot reload which means a turnaround time of usually less than 30 seconds in my case)	Thanks for your reply. So if I'm not mistaken, what I need to do is as follows: 1) Write my code in VS, 2) Right click on my project, 3) Click "Build" 4) Go to engine and "hot reload"?
At 310 Km/h there is a error message comming in the center gauge cluster. I would bet it could explain the origin of "the noise" over 305... 	Yeah it sounds like a warning sound.

I really want the Browns to win a Superbowl or at least become competitive because these daily shit-on-the-Browns posts are getting really old.	It’s a win win for me, I’ll be happy if they’re really good or really bad. They’re really the perfect team. 
I tried changing my diet after seeing my doctor (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine), and he recommended going gluten free. This is after maybe 2 or 3 weeks between the top left pic and the right. I’ve heard food allergies/intolerances can be a culprit. I later did a food panel and it confirmed a gluten intolerance.	How do you get a food panel done? Is it through your doctor or do you have to seek it out on your own?
I'm surprised that 4 slices were even grabbed.	I mean when you’re vegetarian and that’s the food available to you, that’s what ya eat. Though I would’ve been quite happy with plain old cheese pizza. It’s weird how people think vegetarian = people that want to eat vegetables constantly. 
Is there a science to how quickly tolerance for alcohol goes away?	Are we talking like overall tolerance as in lifetime or just in a smaller sample?

I feel like we are putting too much pressure and emphasis on the fa cup now.	No, the cup is almost essential now. Its so important for the morale of the players and the fans. We have the players, just not the confidence. FA cup this year is a much much bigger boost than going for 2nd. 
get splat2n n say goodbye 2 reality 	I heard that splatoon is not nearly as fun if you don't have friends to play it with?
Part 7 = LaChappa 	I'd say Shelly, actually. Lachappa has 10/10 repair so he has a defined role at least. Shelly, however, has no defined role, much like part 7. Both are considered the worst of their cast as well.

I think it's going to be the Bears and Niners getting Arob &amp; Watkins. The other really WR needy teams can't come close to our cap space, unless an unknown team (Jets if they can't land Cousins?) jumps in. 	I think the Rams have enough capital to re-sign Watkins now after all their moves.

I've made installation of cl-notebook simpler by using Qlot and Roswell: https://github.com/inaimathi/cl-notebook/pull/9 Now it is very easy to setup on OSX and Linux.	Nice !

I am know it is more of an unsatisfaction Than a bug	But if it's stopping me from being able to brawl properly, then it really is a bug. It's not that I don't like it; it's stopping me from playing. That's the problem. All they need to do is implement a "fixed" option in the settings.
I love the idea of meal prepping, but I can't seem to make myself do it. The closest I get is pre logging food. What kinds of things do you prep that keep well all week?	I found it easier to start with things whose textures/flavors don't get weird, like soups and chili.  I now do other things like burrito bowls, casseroles, or things that do well reheated in the oven (like enchiladas).
It would be cool if movies were led by the creative direction of 1 or a small group of people who actually wanted to make the movie instead of letting it be driven by test screenings. I mean... who is in these test screenings?	The problem isn't test screenings themselves. It's people in the production not knowing how to use the information you get from test screenings.

I want to play my Nintendo Switch in docked mode. I've been mainly playing it in handheld mode by now. I am going to buy a new TV but I don't know which one to choose that is best for switch. I have a choice between 40inch 42inch and 49inch. Which one will be the best for Switch's picture? I don't want it to look blurry or the picture look stretched out. I want the sharpest contrast and color. Please help me to choose.  	I got a 49 LG UHD and the Swtich looks awesome on it, even games like stardew valley really benefit from the higher pixel count and vibrant colors. Honestly the switch is an amazing piece of tech

I have been going to a learn to run 5K clinic every Monday for the past 6 weeks and it’s been great. Yesterday we had a guest speaker come in before the run who started by saying “If any of you want to talk about weight loss you can contact me after. I’ve lost over 50 lbs and can tell you about why counting calories doesn’t work”. I didn’t believe a thing he said from that point forward. 	Oh boy. I definitely would have quietly fumed. Did he say how he did it then? I'm actually curious lol *Just this one simple trick! Weight loss experts^hate^him!*
Went with No Mothering route first, and picked Sweet Ending so I can get the voice clip. Just need 600 more glamour points to finish it. Trying not to spend money because I know I'm already going to end up buying that little package w/his POV and voice clip, etc. 	Just wondering, is the event story/voice clip event are saved? (I mean we can read it all over again) if yes, where it was saved?
I mean, in 2018, is it too much to ask for them to create "Reraise Head gear" or Reraise Scroll, or Reraise Potion... I mean FFXI has this way back in 2003.... Make some sort of re-raise potion where you can raise yourself, be hidden undetected for 30 seconds to give you time to move away from aggro Mobs and loose maybe 10% of your XP instead. Craftable items from Alchemy, or you can buy them from NPC vendor for 50k Gill. High Quality Craftable items give you 60 seconds buffs and only loose 5%.	To be fair this game doesn't have options that older games have that should be in. Besides those items an actual ping bar would be nice instead of checking my task manager.
Do I get downvoted if I say I want Lebron to get his 4th ring? Cause I do.	I mean I down vote you on principal. But if you want that I mean it's not impossible. I just would rather my team at least beat him in the playoffs
I would watch it to see if it gets darker after awhile from the light. If not, could be nutrient related.	Definitely a neutrient problem with that texturing. Likely calcium or nitrogen but there are better guides out there than me for such things.

Now I really want to do this to embarrass my kids, but I would most likely fall over and take out a rack of shirts. Edit: after thinking about it more, that would embarrass my kids even more, so I will be trying this ASAP.

Or at least jokingly accuse them of wanting you to create their job security.

Truth.  Pandas are too lazy to even breed, and only want to eat one thing. It's like we are keeping them from going extinct and they are resisting our efforts. (females will only entertain the idea of breeding for a couple days every year.)	Well they had a lot of success living in forests of bamboo that not many other organisms wanted to eat. The bamboo used to grow faster than people could cut it down but there are more people now.
I am having a major problem with this sub lately. Namely: why isn't it next Saturday yet!? I mean, seriously, how long do we have to wait before the mods do something about this?

To the people saying that Europa League is more interesting than the UCL because it's more diverse: You are given the choice of either watching the UCL or the EL for the rest of the season. Would you choose the EL? I'm genuinely curious	As long as Juve is part of the UCL, I'll be watching that. In a scenario where this isn't the case, I think I'd honestly choose the EL...
Is it possible to get all ornaments in the next Rally? 	Yes, it will be the last rally to get the season 2 ornaments. You actually have two weeks for them (the winning week, too), but you have to pledge in the first week and can't change that pledge.
Even though I've been following NASCAR since the 90's, I always forget Kyle drove for Hendrick briefly.	It's not hard to forget, it was a blink-and-you-miss-it kind of deal. I forget it as well and I followed Hendrick almost religiously in the '00s

Chaining gets dull quick though. NM farming is more fun due to a mix of chaos and interesting chats both in shout and parties. Plus if the group is large enough and I'm barely getting hits in I can join the afk group and do something else while waiting. If I'm not chatting or fighting Ive been pulling out a textbook and studying, thus I'm still getting decent exp, crystals and being productive at the same time	So they've created content that's entirely about not playing the game?

Because there gets to a point where I have 7 of them and will never ever use them because I never get into emergencies because at the point the only way to get into an emergency is if you actually want to...	Haven't played for a bit, did they remove the teleport wolves?
Colorado has some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. 	And some of the worst drivers 😂
Palisades are easy to set up. The only advantage to stone or cast walls is the height, damage resistance and durability. For a small hamlet, if the palisades are inside the city claim, it should be fine. The wooden gatehouse is 90 construction though	"The wooden gatehouse is 90 construction though" It'd all be inside the City (T1 max), so that's good to know, thanks. 
Is your girlfriend single?	Let's read that again, slowly. /s
The dancing scene in Ex Machina. 	That scene was by FAR the most terrifying part of the whole movie. Really sold that guy as an absolute monster of a villain.
his t shirt is too small	I can’t stand wearing a T-shirt that isn’t long enough. Drive me ducking insane
My brother was telling me just this morning that KDB was going to be the Player Of The Season...he has since reconsidered that position lol. 	I’m surprised that this many people see Salah as the favourite. I still think KDB will win it, although it’s obviously between these two and I won’t be surprised if any of the two win it.
You screenshot/record it and send it to the Ubisoft support team so they can send it along.	Thanks. Ive sent it to the team. Not sure if anything will come of it, but it needed to be done

My best friend told my girlfriend that he loved her and she started talking with him on a daily basis. This is a current situation in my life at the moment.	Good luck with that...
Anyone know what that bridge pickup is? The neck one looks like a Carvin. 	I’m curious too. 
Don't you worry, just continue playin for half an hour till the end of the league and you are bound to catch 'em all.	Nice meme 
That cat is fairly intense! 	what do you mean... he's not camping
Once I did this in JavaScript, line breaks are accurate:     someFunctionThatTakesAFilterFunctionArgument(function() { return     1; }); Took me a while to figure out why the filter function was returning undefined. I wish ;s mattered in JS.	That line would trip my mental parser quicker than Elmer Fudd.
Well, they are inferior in that they do not have virtues like bravery and honesty, so they have to rely on trickery and backstabbing in order to rule everything. In that logic, e.g. the current refugee situation in Europe is engineered to weaken their cultures and make them more susceptible to Jewish rule and less aware of it. (Obviously that is not my own opinion but an explanation that the two are not mutually exclusive.)

Anyone else notice the full moon behind it? *Curse of the Werechicken*	This is what I thought. And the moon looks like a cracked egg. Imagine if that happens and all chickens turn to werechickens. ¡Dios Mio!
Stop threatening and follow through.  Stop playing.	Done.
Makes sense to me. Jiren talks about strength, what better way to show that than to increase those 	Do you even lift,goku?
Very nice episode, it's weird to think that there is only one left. But they showed Frieza in the flashback just like the rest. So Frieza is one of the good guys now?	Nah, Freeza is and will always be evil. He just needs Goku in the ring.
Would you take a custom flair if the mods offered you one? I support the idea.	Yeah i would ;)
We really need FVV with Lowry out. Our big men didn't have an answer for Adams, but man was Bebe great. Dude always stays ready. 	I wanted to see him get more time. He's got length and is an underrated rebounder. Led the raptors in DREB for the game and he only got 6 minutes.
Sounds like a great day! I'm happy for you, and excitedly waiting for my turn! Also, what's a guardian bell?	A trinket to ward off bad luck. Traditionally you buy one for someone else to keep them safe while riding.  Not supposed to buy one for yourself. Example below. https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wXNEXsY2L._SY400_.jpg

My grandad did the "moon diet". He only drank water for like a month and ate bread when the hunger was too strong. 	That sounds rather dangerous
"Inventing" a product. 	"Writing" a book or song 
A lot of people use TAB for fast inventory access but for me I’m almost always pressing shift, which makes you run, and that means any time I press TAB I end up opening in-game Steam interface. So I use G for inventory, because it’s close to F, which is used to interact, and easy to press.	Alternatively change the Steam Overlay bind. Mine's on Shift+F1
/uj that's actually really impressive	yeah, consoles did really improve over the years
Sorry about being a noob for a minute OP I forgot to put my buff on my bar lol	Thanks so much my dude 
The release date for this is only vaguely listed as March 2018. That means that it might come out on Friday, March 23rd, or Friday, March 30th, or could be delayed even later. Not sure why they're being so mysterious about the release date for this soundtrack, so we'll have to see what happens!	I also can not understand the mystery, I hope it does not happen in March, we will have to wait like all the good, any information or opinion on the subject is welcome.
The first step is admitting the problem. Keep going, OP. You’ll get there. 	They haven't even hit the sobering unit yet.  
If I announce a spell, can I both sacrifice a Platinum Emperion to a Krark Clan Iron Works AND pay 1 life to [[Kozilek’s Channeler]] in order to pay for the spell I’ve announced? Edit: wrong card. I mean to reference [[Kozilek’s Translator]]. Can I sacrifice Emperion and pay 1 life to add 1 mana toward a spell I’ve already announced? I know that I could sac the Emperion prior to announcement and then pay life, but I’m drawing an analogy to Matt’s play. 	Yes.
The comment [in context](https://np.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/85gmet/i_dont_understand_why_this_book_is_met_with_such/dvxk4n5/?context=10000). A non-fun game - try to guess which sub. [Spoiler](https://i.redd.it/8l89d8w15nm01.jpg). 	Lol wow, that guy is getting dunked on pretty hard by the people there.
Hmm. LHSIF nearly at their 10day average volume within the first 30 minutes (and down about 4.5%...) — that’s .. interesting? 	LHS is killing me.  Single-handedly offsetting all the gains of my other positions.  One day though .... one day LHS will go on a glorious run and pay me back for my patience.
Pekka doesn't need a nerf. Nobody talked about the card until MK was nerfed and this Golem/Giant meta begun. If Mega Knight gets a little buff to be usable again, and another win conditions become meta she will be forgotten.	For most of the time I've been playing Pekka has only really been viable as a counter-beatdown card. The only time she was viable that I can remember for proactive pushes was during the fairly short time triple P was meta.
Dang he 100% looks like an ancient roman statue. Guess this was another time when they were trying to go back to everything they did. Nice coin! 	Thank you.
So does this mean we won't be able to go 501st on all planets? I guess that's alright if they do it the right way...	Also what would happen if you chose a phase 2 clone skin on kamino? 
My stomach is sensitive today.  I was nauseous before lunch. I ate lunch early, hoping it would help, but my stomach isn’t feeling much better now. 	Take care! I feel like there's a second-wave of illness going on &amp; I know several people who have specifically had stomach bugs.
so my question is, what server is your brd on? cuz i may have ran stuff with them at some point lol 	hiya XD hope I wasn’t directionally challenged when I ran stuff with you LOL
A house	yes good answer. some people says get mobile.
The 100 was for signing up for the newsletter, and if you haven't gotten your points, it's too late now.	Yes. My bad I meant that. I got 100 for linking then never got the ones for signing up for email updates. Haven't gotten any emails either ;(.  This was when the league started so I think I was on time too 
&gt;what should I avoid Being a Scourge Warlock? I kid, I kid. You're only level 40 so you haven't even scratched the surface of the game. If you think you'll be playing it for a month or more, VIP is worth every penny if you don't mind shelling out 10$. It'll also give you the first time buyer pack for free which has some good stuff and another character slot. I'd recommend using any extra character slots and leveling up to 11 so you can invoke on them, and whatever level is required to do random queues for some extra AD. I'd recommend a DC or OP as the alt. Otherwise just keep leveling. The games been around for a while so there's a ton of into out there if you're looking for specific information.	Noob here, I’m guessing astral diamonds and invoking effects and items received from invoking carry from character to character? If not, what am I wrong about here

Agree, there’s a post near the top of all asking for the creepiest thing you found out that fb has done to/with your account.	For me, that it's always listening to you when you think your phone is off and changing its ads accordingly.  Another thing is you can't uninstall it from newer phones like the Samsung S8; you can only 'disable' it, which tells me it's built right into the OS.

Just wondering how someone is playing chess since 2009 on chess.com and his rating is over 1500 in blitz since 2014 gets 891 USCF, i guess that rating is old and he didn't play for long time then played some recent games that made him go up fast in rating. Just advertising ...	Agreed. He had a highly out of date rating, and the improvement was made over a period of years. The rating, unsurprisingly, didn’t catch up until he started playing tournaments again.
It wasn't me, I'm from south east London I'm basically a walking Big Shaq sound board.	Quik maffs?
This sounds good for us.	Hey, just as we were talking about man!
&gt; I excluded dGPU bandwidth because while it differs, it doesn't matter, even an 1050 Ti much less the 1030 equivalent MX150 can't saturate even an x2 link, check this benchmark. The higher GPU benchmarks in the T480 are because of the MaxQ vs non-MaxQ dGPU not because of the PCIe links. So Lenovo engineers made a very stupid design choice with T480: they gave 2 useless extra PCIe lanes to dgpu, leaving the SSD with only 2 PCIe lanes... I think that 2 extra lanes could really improve the disc performance when dealing with large files. 	This decision was made long ago and fixing it would require a redesign of the motherboard and a new type of cable running into the 2.5" bay.
I wish I had bought a 2nd copy of infinity gauntlet issue 1 so I would have one to collect and one to sell once this movie causes the sell prices to go up	It can be a hit or miss man I got my silver surfer 44(first gauntlet appearance) for 20 bucks and I. Honestly expected it to be way more then that then again I got it 2 years ago but I guess time will tell 
Im sure alot of this would be aded later. I would also like different ships, and npc pirates/cities	Added later.... Like an early access title?
Pizza in bed would be messy tho	Not if you're careful.
I'm kind of in the mood for a serious show now that I'm done deep space 9. I'm not saying it has to be Mad Men or The Wire level, but something kind of like that. Any recommendations? 	Rectify. It can be a bit on the slow side story wise, but as far as character development goes it's one of the best.
&gt;P.A.Works Let's go. 	Where?
Not really. I'd like to have seen Patrick Stuart give it a go though. 	I was thinking Patrick Stewart too and possibly Terence Stamp.
I have a job interview waaay up in Johns Creek today. Its at an Ayurvedic wellness center. If I get the job, I'll probably be trained on netra basti--where they pour clarified BUTTER over your eye(s)!! I hope I never have to do it.	I feel like that’s right up Paula Dean’s alley. 
[ohio](#urarahype) How's everyone? What did you dream about? Was I in it? Cool.	You know what I'm relatively certain I woke up this morning and was like 'wow that was a really awesome dream' but I didn't write it down and now I can't remember... [](#sadholo)
For example 2 sadly she's just going to have to deal with it. The reason is because the port replicators work differently than the usb-c docks. The port reps are straight PC bus connections from the motherboard to the extra hardware and the whole software stack was managed by Dell. But in the usb-c case the drivers are managed by a third party (Display Link) and the USB drivers are Intel based. I suggest updating the display link drivers but I doubt that's going to help her since Windows just shuffles everything back onto the laptop and doesn't know to care about window position. You might want to see if there's a third party window manager out there that could 'lock' the windows in place. 	You are possibly incorrect about the "3rd party driver". OP doesn't say which model he's using, but the WD15 doesn't use displaylink, it uses Alt Mode directly from the GPU. The D6000 is Displaylink as you said.
There like 13 in stores I bought two pairs nothing special but yet the job done 	I thought it would better than Milwaukee's torque lock... guess not so.
On a more serious note, should I save those 30M tickets for tomorrow when LM Fina is in the summon pool?	I was wondering the same thing 
I love that this sub supports players outside Liverpool matches as well, sometimes even if they don't play here anymore. That's quite charming.	He's still a Liverpool players, just on loan at Hull.
I think this is satire.	Most likely
Are you happy with your naan? It looks nice and thin and potentially a little bit crispy. Thanks for the tips below.	I am. I've made it a few times already but this time it was perfect. It was soft and chewy but the burned part is crispy. I think it's the combination of using whey instead of water and proofing it longer than 5 hours.
textbook on how to answer Mueller 	I don't know. I don't know.  I don't know.
What game is that	Jumping on the notification train
I got this one wrong as well with the same logic. After thinking about it for a bit I think this might be the answer. General idea of osmosis.  More salt on one side.. Water flows to that side. In this case (normally) more protein is on the blood side.  This causes fluid to flow out of the tissue and into the blood. In the questions case.  There is less protein on the blood side.  This causes LESS water to flow out then if there was protein present. It more so the fact that the water stays were it is instead of going back into the blood stream.  This results in more fluid in the tissue. 	Thanks! 
I'd probably have Casey and Verrett on the outside. King was so productive in the slot. Or just have Verrett and Trevor compete for the outside spot	Did they ever experiment with King at safety? I thought I heard some rumblings about it when they drafted him but I might be thinking of someone else.
dear hockey gods may i have another tyler johnson goal please?	aaaaaaand ANOTHER ONE after that pls
seoul is going to choke this map by being overconfident once again. they never learn.	Definitely their biggest problem. 
Any vegetarian options? 	I get the impression that their menu cycles in and out based on any number of factors, so maybe it isn't available all the  time, but today, my girlfriend was able to get a burrito with a mixture of potato and cauliflower in it, and she loved it.
Funny how the "It's not your height it's your personality" crew is nowhere to be seen in this thread...	Oh please. In this instance, it was his height. In some instances, it isn’t. The personality point is that for many women, you being interesting and fun to be with can override you being short. For some, it cannot. This year-old confession in no way invalidates that. 
Awesome, and btw Sony apparently lost a lawsuit dealing with that fat one so I think you can still claim like 60 bucks or so from it. I'll see if I can get the link	If you look at the bottom there is a deadline to make a claim. April 15, 2018. They have a final hearing on May 29th, 2018.
To clarify, I am working right downtown. I probably need a lot in that area or something within a 1/2 mile walk. My kid is almost already at the 10 hour daycare max with my regular workday and driving commute.	Is there parking near the daycare and a bus nearby that runs to Bellevue?
SEC SEC SEC	We won the conference challenge.
They have to try to get at least a first or second... right now they’re going to be picking what 4th round? 	Ya a second or third. Doubt they can get a first without giving up a pretty good prospect or roster player.
TOOT	Thank you fish!
yeah i forgot bard was the ONLY CLASS in the entire game to ever use peloton or have the capability, like everyone else in this thread	Well to be fair,  MCH could do this as well.  
Man, ARAM again? Sigh. At least it looks like you only need to play only 2 matches this time!	I like arams, what's wrong with them?
Yeah I've been playing it for a few hours now and it has been laughably easy. I hope it gets a bit more challenging later because so far its been pretty disappointing.	Yeah you have way too much HP. And i-frames are super forgiving. I literally just fight my way through all the stealth parts because elite guards are super easy
This is why I read the patch notes: &gt; Garglechomp Hobblegob remains unchanged since 1.0.4.	The fact they added him into the patch notes, despite nothing being updated, just to make a Benedict Cumberbatch pun, makes me love Thiccshark even more. 
Except that when you send your phone in they will deny your warranty.  They said my phone was water damaged, but it was working great until it bootlooped. There are lots of people having warranty claims denied for any reason that LG can think of.  Then they charge you $20 to get your phone back.  I consider it the last $20 that LG will ever get from me.  	Why would you want it back at that point are there alternate ways to repair?
Watch there not be the one size that SFS is looking for	Nope. We actually packed them all up because we don’t have room for 130+ of these (not including ones on the floor)
I would be interested. Have made sushi before and its one of my favorite meals. 	Thanks! We are a go for April 2 @6:30pm. The ticket link will be up tonight at birminghamsishiclasses.com/classes 
Check out the PureFlow or PureCadence, not zero drop, but 4mm.	Heading to my local shoe store to try the PureFlows. Thanks. =)
https://youtu.be/fySc9brl6-w Was it this guys video?	No, but this is basically what the item is but massively manufactured for profit I assume. Made of plastic it looked like, was $16 bucks or something lol. 
They'll be added in later.	&gt;They’ll be sold in a DLC, or released as a “free” update alongside the DLC FTFY
Tech Support tag? Stop doing that. [Solved]	I didn’t tag it, the mods did.
PM visited him in his hotel for 2 hrs.  Escorted everywhere he goes. Private speech.. he’s protected and up to NO good!	Yep, he's likely looking for money and a safe place to land
Erm .. mb I'm missing something .. but instead of carrying a totem, couldn't you just as well carry around an enderchest or shulker box in your off-hand? Or is it about direct-access inventory? Then they would have to change the gui for that, and then I'd recommend 9 extra slots to match with the current geometry of the inventory.	that's what i mean yeah and i meant 9, but typed 7 direct access yes
...and? You make it? 	nope
Oxygen Forensics can do the analysis	And does it very well too I might add
You know, if no-complies and footplants could click for me that'd be really nice. I literally cannot do them to save my life. 	Same for me with front side/backside 180 Ollie's.
Sounds like you ovulated early in march. 2 days isn't enough time after ovulation to implant (and therefore get a positive) and while it's possible to have been pregnant for a month with negative tests, it's extremely rare, so with the most likely outcome pointing at first week of March ovulation. Congrats btw!	Would that just mean that the two tests I took that were negative were just a couple of days too early? Maybe the cycle I thought was supposed to start on the 15th was actually later then?
I'm just glad we aren't getting blown out	that wont happen until the 2nd half. i want you guys to wins so bad 
The *real* secret is buying up the cheap corrupted failures and making a Shaped Loreweave ;)	Huh, I wonder if that will work

Hm, interesting strategy this, campaigning after polls close... fascinating stuff	If this is how it works, I might run for PM again. 
Either it's a coincidence, or you saw my comment.	Which comment?
The only time I ever had a problem with someone on food stamps was when they took a very long time deciding on what items to put back when they were out of food stamps. It was a choice between precut apples, Cocoa Puffs or chocolate bars. Apples lost. The beer won too but they paid cash for that. 	There's nothing wrong with a bit of chocolate.  This goes for poor people, too. 
I really like Lyric fm and listen to it in the car but really don't like Movies and Musicals. I seem to regularly be stuck on long journeys on Saturday afternoons too so it feels like time that I could have really enjoyed if I was listening to some nice classical music or maybe John Kelly's Mystery Train. Instead I'm stuck in the car listening to Julie Andrews singing at children. Nothing to do with your post I know, but I just wanted to grumble.	Some of the best music is from films. Just look at the scores for "The Lion King" or "How to Train Your Dragon."

Can you PM me the username of the buyer? I had this same thing w/ a buyer last year. Really he was fishing for a partial or full refund. I kept telling him to return it and I would pay return shipping. He wouldn't do it and instead kept telling me it didn't work and I needed to fix it. I said I couldn't fix it unless he returned it. He never did and ultimately even left me positive feedback. 	Update: Buyer's yet to file any dispute or leave any feedback. I'm going to go with your theory that he or she was just fishing for a partial or full refund and I will not take any action at this time

Swordfish...all fish can have parasitic worms. But swordfish can be riddled with them. Let's just say it's pretty unappetizing.	I thought only saltwater fish actually. And fish that migrate between them like Salmon and Sea Trout. 
Uhh, anyone care to explain what is happening at Haas? I honestly thought that I would see a Haas podium today.	They're still the newest team on the grid.  
I just played it now, the strike modifier was solar and specialist. I ran about 25 strikes , it was so dam good. I'll never play D1 the way I used to but going back to strikes was always my place in destiny and that will go on for as long as the game is online.	I might jump on in a bit, I've got a few hours to spare this evening.

This is just straight up sad. What's the context here? 	Ah, yes. The work of edgy teens.
I've never owned one, but the reviews usually are poor.  You're better off buying a well-reviewed, basic sewing machine.	Yeah i just can't afford that yet, trying to save money for baby coming in May so I thought a mini machine might be good to just try out first before I invest too much money
I've seen a few reviews of Brassard's metas on transbucket and they are usually pretty good. I've only only really heard of bad reviews of his MtF surgeries.	I just got an account and finally looked into it. They look great, it's nice to see some from the actual surgeon.

For me anything with less that 5 skills to unlock is not worth building,  just feed the 1 stars into another 1 star to make him a 2 star then feed more one stars into the 2 star to make a 3 star then when you have 3 of the 1 or 2 skill 3 stars feed it into a good 3 star to unlock there 4th skill This is what my storage looks like just focusing on 5 skills http://imgur.com/31aovaR I will keep the doubles of 3+ star level them up until i'm able to feed them into a 4 star version on them self. Also 30 is max no more than that yet.	Thanks so much for the tips!!!

The layout of your sheet, especially the sheet for your recipes, is making it pretty hard to do proper lookups. Try laying out your data so 1 row = 1 recipe. Add as many columns as you like, but resist adding more than 1 row for the ingredients for a single recipe. This means you can now do VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH formulas to look up all the ingredients and quantities for each of your meals without having to enter the formulas again every time.	What can I do about multiple ingredient items. For example soup is just one can where breakfast sandwich has 4 parts. I see this be the biggest problem for “by weekly order” 
reminds me of the Skimmers from Elite Dangerous...	Man, I wish Elite: Dangerous, Osiris: New Dawn, and Subnautica had babies.
Hi.	Do you think you should come faster? 
I’m getting 70k/hour xp at level 87 agility without bonus xp. This is the only skill I cared about doing here thee next few weeks anyway.	At that level you can get 85k xp/hr at Hefin course without any boosts. So not efficient to do Fayre unless you don't have prif unlocked. 
Anyone every try Friendly? Only draw back I see is it doesn't look like it has push notifications	Using friendly. It has notification support, no idea about push. Great app. Linkme: friendly
I’d say this is a good build. After Effects doesn’t really benefit from a GPU, Premiere does though. But especially if you want to have all programs running at the same time 32GB RAM is a better choice than a GPU, honestly I think you’ll benefit most from the i7 CPU here. Again, very nice!	Thanks! 
1998- not sure i can think of any? Thought Tyler Bate but turns out he was 97. 	[Here's a list.](http://prowrestling.wikia.com/wiki/Category:1998_births) Can't say I have heard of any of them. 
Be a guest on the podcast sometime!  Group message Charm3 and me.	Can confirm that we'd like some more people taming dragons with a blade on our podcast.
That would be so Brown's. And then we could Draft Darnold and all be happy boys and girls	This would make your Metlife neighbors pretty happy too. 
You are unironically asking this question?	Just curious why you guys love communism 
Understood, also can you explain what counts as "entities"?	So in simplest terms, an entity is any card that is currently on the field. This will include Resonators, Additions, Regalia (in Wanderer), and J-Rulers.
Rakdos colors? Dont forget [[havoc festival]].	Oh trust me, that will be in my Mogis deck. Chaos for life!!!
Amp/DAC question.  My receiver supposedly has a great DAC built in.  However, the receiver is a bit underpower for my headphones.  I am looking at getting a headphone amp.  If I get something that is a DAC/amp combo, will it override the built-in DAC in the receiver or can I essentially turn off the DAC in the DAC/amp combo?  Or, should I focus on getting something that is just an amp and plug that into the receive.  TIA!	Some DAC/Amp combo units have an analog input (e.g. 3.5mm, RCA). If you use that, it'll bypass the DAC of the combo unit. Of course, I'd just go for a standalone amp and not pay for the DAC circuitry if I'm not going to use it.
Kilroy was here. 	Underrated comment
Where can I get theseeee	Any sporting goods store will have them 
Oh... Is this a coincidence? :O https://www.tweaktown.com/news/61336/nvidia-lists-gtx-10-series-cards-out-stock/index.html	Did they have stock in those cards before...? Seems likely to me that they're all actually out of stock.
Maybe I am missing something, but how many years? Seems like an important variable.	Most likely similar to the deal the Phillies just gave their prospect. 6 years with an option or two.
bump. I as well. 	If nothing comes up before tomorrow, I'll create a league like this and start looking for people 
Isn't Sonic basically an Anime character?	No he is a hedgehog are you being dumb on purpose?
I talked to the guys from Boarders a few years ago on distribution of my game and they seems like very nice people. Sad to see that the company has fallen to such a state.	The ones who have a carefully cultivated image of being nice people are probably the ones we gotta worry about the most.. D:
WOW, congratz, that was a fast one, thank you. 	Things were only broken for a week. Im legitimately surprised
Does the nurse shark count as a shark?	I doubt it. It was just recently added and is a fusion fish. Fusion fish counting towards things is very, very inconsistent. Try with a regular shark.
Pertinent bloodline?	He refers to himself as an "old world aristocrat" all the time.
You CAN do those things. But if you wanna pay the bills, you probably shouldn't. 	Not necessarily true, yea its true not everyone is a star, but I know grips that got nicer cars than you.  
Interesting, previously I read climate change was creating food crisises which is causing an increase in conflicts. (But not the only cause) Chicken and egg situation...	I read this in the voice of Wallace.
Extremely light steering wheels.	Similarly, the light pedal in late model Tundras.  Geez.  On a rough bumpy road I keep blipping the throttle vvrrrrr vrrrr vrrrr
I'm going to stop OHPing for a while. I'll come back to it eventually, but viking press is feeling really good at the moment. I'm going to stick with that for a bit. This is based on the advice of /u/WeaponizedSleep and /u/trebemot. Team NoOHP! :)	Why would you remove the only lift that matters?
Will you be able to pick your friends up from the airport? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68JQtxTzjqc	What. On. Earth.
Are you able to equip/unequip the covenant? If so, and you've restarted the game, you may have to create a new character and try again. First, though, I'd recommend setting the covenant and unequipping it a couple of times to see if that triggers it. 	Yes, I am able to do it I will try
Can confirm. Good luck dude!	Thanks again, I really appreciate it!
Rather than just upgrading for the sake of it, list the reasons for each equipment and why; this makes it easier to prioritize. You may find things can easily be put off till next cycle or consolidated. Also doesn't hurt to do a refresh of your requirements for all systems/requipment rather than just buying the newest like model. Frequently I have seen things being purchased but features never being used/taken advantage of to any significant degree. Without those features, there could be a large cost savings.	I'm trying to find things that the users will notice and also make the bean counters happy.  I know I'm grasping at straws here, I was hoping you folks had some great idea that I hadn't been thinking of.  
Which screen and keyboard did you go with?	Keyboard: CanaKit CK-KB-101 Screen: RPi 7” Touchscreen 
My gf's pupils are naturally different sizes. So, it could be worse than just 24 hours at a time.	Didnt say it was bad, i find it pretty awesome, but i feel sorry for her
Hey buddy, I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling that way. Congrats on gaining admittance, that’s a huge accomplishment. You applying 3 times shows me that not only are you resilient af but that you also believe in yourself enough to apply 3 times. You’re gonna do great in med school	Thanks Pcsknine. I'll try to stay positive. 
I love these things but the best thing is leaving the package open for a couple days and they get soft and it's heaven on Earth. I'm also weird and like stale chips and Peeps so may not be for everyone. 	I love stale peeps! You're not alone!
I will find a way to mod your face in, mark my words 	go forward and tell me afterwards! Would be kind of funny to see it ingame haha.. ;)
Would love a cape that hangs from only one shoulder, maybe even attaches to the hip too, like a sash. 	*Auditore intensifies*
Would you take 12? I can do first and do f&amp;f	Nevermind i thought it was for the game not the season pass
This is awesome.  If you gave him an answer to every one of those questions then perhaps you'd be a little exhausted, but it means he learned 115 new things that day.  That's inspiring stuff.	You'd think so, but that's not what happens. 90% of the time they ask why to get your attention or annoy you (or both) and they don't actually listen to the reply. After you're done with the reply you didn't listen to, you just get another "Why?"
Is it going to be called the Shazier Rule? 	That's what im calling it.
Before 1.4.1, was it a mod that made the monitors inside the cockpit controllable to display different gauges, tools, stats, etc.? or was that a natural part of the game? I feel like they aren't there anymore, or am I totally wrong? 	Rasterprop monitor does that
Offer any advice on wrapping with ni80? It's so springy I find it difficult to work with.	Torch ir first. 
A few more spaceships here… https://thisnorthernboy.blog/2018/03/28/sketchbook-spaceships/	Nice! How do you like those Copic multiliners? Do you think they make a big difference compared to other brands like sakura micron, if you are able to compare?
Actually you can't. You will eventually pass out and you will start breathing unconciously.	Wrap an airtight mask around your mouth and nose.
Sub 4 sub is pointless as you won't get any views from it. It's just a way for people to grow the sub counter but that matters for very little	Pointless, the people that subscribe to you will have thousands of subscriptions because of the sub 4 sub thing and they wont notice your channel = no views :)
Should mention why chose Cisco over Juniper. Juniper wins hands down in my book, but Cisco still more popular and affordable.	Just curious... why do you feel that Juniper wins over Cisco?
Don't know about that kit specifically. But regarding 1T vs 2T, when gear down mode is enabled, as I understand it, the command rate setting has no effect. So get the ryzen timing checker app to see if gear down mode is enabled. With it is set to auto in the bios, I've found that it is usually enabled. 	thx for the suggestion, will give it a try.
I mean even a camera on the back would make a huge improvement 	I feel like the next wave of WMR will have back cameras, maybe even sides BUT I know nothing about how it processes all the imagery and that might be too much computing.
Where was this?	Data mines during the beta
Same post as a minute ago	Yea I deleted the other one 
AFLW Grand Final and a Bulldogs premiership = Play #2 of the week. Ablett kicks a goal = #1.	Seems correct to me

Do society a favor and take out a couple of the worst humans I know of.	What happens when someone decides you're one of those people?
I'd like to see a third DLC like these pictures. Link and Zelda, post-Ganon adventures. 	We just wait for the next full game to come now, BotW's development is donezo.
ugh. i wish they were all like this. 	Honestly was super surprised about how they came 
I have •Friend: gligar •Heavy: pineco, bidoof, and trubbish •Lure: sentret •Moon: burmy, buizel, and dunsparce	Hi! I'm out for a day trip today, so I'll only be able to confirm the trade with you when I return home. Also, usual question: All the mons have HA, right?
For a single yard? Input, Titans fans?	Double *their* price for Seahawks fans
This will change your spray control. You will have to get used to it again at this new sensitivity. 	Spraying to me feels a lot easier now.
&gt;Jesus Chris the world is full of salty people. Do people not know boosting is a thing in all mmo’s? It’s literally a plot point in ready player one the book I dont know who has fewer braincells, this dude or his community....	Also Sea of Thieves isn't really an MMO :(
What about a picatinny rail with a ladder over it? Or a purpose built mount like the [Samson MLOK GoPro mount] (https://www.samson-mfg.com/m-lok-direct-gopro-mount-kit.html)?	Unfortunately the camera isn't compatible with go-pro mounts. I did however find that MI makes a mount for Contour Roam cameras that should work as they have a 1/4x20 threaded post that the camera can be secured to. That should do the trick. 
trash	The a is small and the t is farther away from the r and y than the rest of the letters. But I wouldn't say *trash*... Just not great
You couldn't just fly up there? Is it inaccessible or something. 	I am level 40. So no, I couldn't just fly of here.
Should be an 'either' option for the first question. I did not perceive it as one or the other. 	How do you mean? It says “select either option to start”
So I don’t want to take Vixen’s moment...  but I just don’t feel like she deserved the win? I feel like the other team did better. But even on Vixen’s team, Mayhem/Kalorie were more entertaining? This challenge wasn’t bad, but the divisions on both teams were a bit off. 	I don’t even know how she won the mini challenge?
Hey thats not bad..i went in a game earlier today,i got 13 kills,and my mates got in total 3.Also we lost the chicken dinner,beacuse one of them didnt realise that he has to revive me if im near to death,haha	Just the 2 min survive time :D

Not US Marine training, that is "log PT" in BUD/S (A.K.A. Navy Seal Training).	While you're right that it's buds. We had log PT in MCRD SD (boot camp) as well
Rarely allow your self to be alone, fill your time with activities outside your house. This has been a big one for me.	This is something I can't avoid for the next 40 days , I am home for preparing for my exams starting on 11 may . I also don't have any libraries around . 
Why do I hear bass	Yes! I hear a satisfying zooowwmb.
The tale of two Novas. The last three batters he was throwing some filthy stuff. I'm so impressed he got out that without giving up a run.	Hopefully TG was taking notes! 
So it seems like the more money you make the less likely you are to get burnt out.... Lol jk sorta. Thanks for posting it, interesting to see it put together in a graph like that	Psych and peds seem to be an exception to that trend
I exclusively only buy Hextech items. Bought the Capsule Bundle, spent 3500 RP to get 6475 worth of permanent skins and emotes.	That sounds like a good deal 
What are your thoughts on Napoleon's dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire?	Four legs good. Two legs bad.
Do Cavs get a 2nd LeBron? 	How about shaq (if he'll be in his prime)
I've seen AT LEAST 50 users just today getting scammed trying to deposit on a gambling site without trade hold, even when the site clearly says "Under maintenance" when you try to deposit anything, lol.	Yeah. Not sure what Valve expected tbh
Ben's design looks so cool, props to you man. 	So much borrowed from Matt the radar technician.
mine was a few days ago i wish i got one of those gift cards that you can use anywhere to order stuff. i want to get the mega bundle for the new hawthorne heights album but knowing how my parents feel about literally any non christian music my step dad will probably argue with my mom about me asking for them to order it for me even if i give them the cash(i could probably ask one of my older siblings though but all of them have moved out by now)	also more money so i could buy the mega bundle and a sweater that says "i used to listen to hawthorne heights in high school." (it will never be accurate because i'll still probably be listening to hawthorne heights when i grow up so i'll be an emo husband/dad)
This problem is also on consoles, so weird. The controller just randomly vibrates.	Thanks 
I don't think it's weird. Although if I'm being honest, I think it's less weird for a girl to do (I've known a few that told me they still sleep with a stuffed animal), whereas for a guy it might be seen as weird. Although if I was living alone I'd totally do it.	I prefer guys who freely admit they like cute stuff to those that try to act overly macho but that’s just one opinion 
She's only 18...	Doesn't even look like the same person 
the xp you get is elite captain xp, so you can use it to train whoever.	This, the 19 point captain/free elite xp alone makes this mode super generous. No matter what you think of the space mode itself, free elite xp is fantastic.
Can I have more than one? u/watermelonboye u/rootfridge u/stance_nation and the rest of this sub tbh 	Yay!
So inviting!  I want to trace my tongue along the edges. ;). Jr is waking up just thinking about it. 	I'd love that 💋
Modlist? I'm trying to build my perfect game and I really like those colors! 	For colours i use: Vivid Weathers Enhanced Lights and FX Caffeine ENB (which does most of it)
Are the pellets too big for him to swallow?	He’s eaten them before which is why it’s weird. 
Now this is something special.	We didn't actually end up tripping that night, but now that we've got everything cleared up we plan to very soon.  Last night was probably the most beautiful night of my life regardless.
As someone who is also a Liverpool fan I think I need a valium after this afternoon....	&gt;Liverpool fan Hopefully you will pull trough this terrible affliction.
So to clarify this is all positions, not just looking up down left right? Like if I want to look at my guage cluster in project cars 2 can I just move closer to read it? 	Not too sure about this, he says x/y not z so I'd imagine you can't go forward/back yet.
I was watching the rekkles pov stream and kept seeing the support typing out things like https://imgur.com/umIhvm5. Does anyone know what he is tracking?	Different cooldowns, mainly summoners.
Hey announcer guys, here's a thought: maybe *don't* jinx Lance all inning talking about how great he is when there's still a no-hitter going on? /s 	Oh you're one to talk about jinxing no-hitters.
Pels if anyone asks the score is low because of two elite defensive performance, nothing to do with bad offence, deal? 	I feel like our defense has been good though
He can set a userflair as soon as someone comments or posts, but he can’t set flair for lurkers.	How can I do that
Congratulations!!!! Great news all around!	Thank you!!! We are very happy with the house choice and all the new beginnings it brings!
I though it was weird they included "Present Day" since that's assumed anyway.  It really makes me wonder if there'll be an unlockable 1993 mode or something.	It could easily just be a cinematic explaining the history of the park ending in "present day"
[NA] Currently, is there any holy grail that is not possible to obtain anymore?	no

Question: why do people care about special offers? They've never bothered me	With special offers you have to swipe to open to your book, and without them you don't. Just a small convenience thing. Some people say they get rather inappropriate special offers too, like raunchy romance novels or whatever. Wouldn't want to show that in public.
Can still barely fit through the door though, but hands are bigger now.....I’ll give you that. 	r/KenM

A former coworker had 2 kids: Nevaeh and Nephartiri. I’m not sure which was worse. 	Did they have no idea how to spell Nefertiti, because that might explain it. 
Congrats! How does 30 days feel? The confidence will come if you are improving your life in other areas of your life such as physical fitness, mental health, etc. Just be patient.	Question how come your NoFap Moderator thing is green instead of red?
You should have auto picked up the gold pendant. Check your inventory. If it isn’t there, it’s garbage so it doesn’t matter.	That's indeed the case. :p Thanks.
Wow very nice work, very talented.	Thank you! :)

Looking to explore Birkenstock sandals for the first time. 1. Have very flat feet 2. Prefer neutral colors 3. Have wide feet that can swell like balloons overdosing on helium Which Birkenstock would you recommend? I’ve seen ones that are true slides and others that sort of wrap around the big toe - thoughts? Experiences/reviews? Help! There are so many that it’s intimidating. 	I like the classic Arizona slides because you can wear socks with them. Maybe not the most fashionable look, but they're so comfy I like to continue wearing them through the fall when my feet would otherwise get cold. 
hey everyone	hey
This happened to me as well. Isn't there any solutions for this?	Devs needs to change the colour.
It's actually terrifying how many men out there actually just throw money at women who do nothing but show off their body. 	Ever been to a strip-joint?

I’m jealous that everyone else has a rival 	You and me baby. It’s happening. 
Have you ever brought your art to ComicCon?  Maybe work your art into some comics and create a following in a few local comic book shops.  I know guys who do this.  One guy just about breaks even, but he gets to the ComicCon, compares notes with some better known artists, and improves all the time.  He even knows some publishers and ComicCon is a place where they look for talent.  Good luck.	Does the art have to be comic book style? I’m more of a realism illustrator, but this seems like a really great idea! Thank you so much for the info! 
I know nothing about baseball other than bases and trying to get a strike but that is great form...	It is a great form.

No, because the store obviously doesn't value the soda at zero.	I see. So, why does the store value the soda at what it values it? What informs my subjectivity is how much I want to drink it, or, whatever, use it in some way. What informs the store's perspective?
Try using isOn not setting it as active and move it to Update()	This worked, thank you a lot.
How do you get to the $17k on the car?	I bought a second car more suited for the job. It cost $17k. My accountant told me I could deduct it as long as it’s used a minimum of 80% for work (it is).
&gt; How do you personally balance the importance of a work mission vs. other things in your life? (e.g., if it becomes the case that this takes away time from personal hobbies or relationships, what would be your breaking point?) Have you thought about what your priorities in life are? Here are mine, in the following order: 1. My health 2. My relationship 3. My family 4. My job/career 5. My friends Notice that my job is not even among the top 3. If I have to choose how to spend my time/resources, I will allocate it according to the list above. Understand how important (or lack thereof) my work is to me helps to put things in perspective and focus my time &amp; energy accordingly. I do what I can to be successful at my job, but not at the cost of the more important priorities.	I think a big challenge for me is that my job is intertangled with my self-esteem / identity, and therefore becomes pretty 'important'. Know what I mean?

I’m proud of her for her courage and strength fighting back! And proud of you for being there for her. May both of you heal as quickly as possible. You are a good friend to be there for her. Don’t forget to seek out support for yourself as well, from people you trust. Not sure if anything else I could say would help. Just know I am sorry there are people out there that could do this, and circumstances, whatever they may be, that could drive someone to do that. I wish both of you the best.	Inadequate to post?

&gt; Some islands have starting layouts. **They can dilapidated or worn out** Interesting. 	Makes me worry we won't get original Jurassic park assets such as the explorer.  But instead just broken down buildings.  Still looking forward to the game, but would be highly disappointed. 
Never knew anything about the beginning being disliked, but good to see you're enjoying it. I myself couldn't find any moment that made me dislike. It might have some parts that irritate me but it was the purpose of the story so I didn't have much problem with it. While lotta people love Umineko for its mysteries, I'm on the minors who find the underlying themes as well as characters to be the best things this VN has to offer. If you don't have any problem with the cast then I'm sure in time you'll find them even more interesting.	Yeah I've read a lot of threads online of people who dropped it because nothing happened in the beginning or whatever
People are cheap.   Uber people are really cheap.	"Price sensitive."
Is it just me, or are there way more established brands in the car markets than most other markets? I'm used to like 5 big companies dominating a market tops.	Many car brands are owned by the same manufacturers.  The five biggest firms (GM, Ford, Toyota, Chrysler, Nissan) account for about 70% of the US auto market.

Is it likely to be able to work full time as a reservist or is that something usually held for members with more seniority? Or is it very trade dependant? Edit: I know the website says it's an option. Just more curious as to how much of an option.	Do not expect full time work out of the Reserves. Hence why it is Part Time service, versus a full time job via Regular Force service. Full Time work in the Reserves is limited and highly competitive. 
It would negatively impact their revenue (and they have investors/targets to meet obviously) so I doubt it will happen. Would be cool though! 	What kind of investors are we talking about here? This is a finished game that gets minor content and balance updates, they aren't developing a new game which they need an investor/publisher for. Smite is a game as a service and they're making enough money with it.
Adderall or related amps/stims. Adderall used to make me super productive, but I used it for fun too much and now it’s just a speedy little buzz.	Thanks for the reply, Is adderal the brand name or the chemical name? Because adderal looks expensive compared to speed paste but arent they the same thing? Sorry if its a stupid question im very uneducated about stims

Might be a creepy person, and if that's the case, just block her or responde wehenever you can as ChemBNM says.... NOW, she may just be exited to have a virtual friend... who knows. If that's the case, it will fade off, so don't worry. You can always talk to her, say that you are not always on the phone and that if you are maybe you dont have time por chitchat, so she should not be offended by your lack of quick response	Thanks! I don't think she's creepy, just lonely - I guess I've been there myself so I know how that feels!

So what's the most credible stories out there about why Lando isn't in the new sequels or why he's not even mentioned so far? Billy D didn't want to do it, producers didn't want to pay him, just a creative story decision etc. 	He isn’t too healthy. A hip replacement has really affected him. He usually gets around in a wheel chair or shuffles slowly with a cane :(

Don't know if that is highschool or college, but that person is far from mature. Also, what was the teacher doing? In my recent years the teachers were always watching if everyone was in a group, if we weren't they'd mention it and make sure I was alright on my own, what did yours say? But now, reflect a bit, what are you looking like? Are you taking care of yourself so you look "normal" or do you let yourself go? You are not worthless based on that, since you haven't done anything wrong, you were judge hastily by a rude individual.	It's college, the teacher doesn't really care about anything, really, and I am below average in looks but I do dress nicely and take care of myself the best I can.

From what people posted, quest is a major trigger of SB.   It is possible they want people to keep playing.  And they know the "quest" feature probably can keep many of the players even if they are shadowbanned(?)  So to try keep majority of the player while also give them warning/shadownban, it is highly possible they use "quest" as a trigger.  So for those people that know about "quest" and want to do "quest", they know they can keep many those player so they give them warning and shadowban.  While for those that not aware of quest, they won't give them warning and scare them away yet until they know about "quest" by clicking on "quest" button??	Keep playing while spoof will just result in a perm ban?
It sounds like you release the fish on purpose, I use that expression when I lose a fish before I get it in the boat.  It makes it sound like I meant to do it!	Yeah, I do that. Caught many pike of that size, so no need to put them out of the water.

1. Adjust the grass to be a bit more green in Stone Hill/Artisans 2. Keep the lightly purple alpine hue for Magic Crafters homeworld. I can accept the current palette for Blowhard since it's reimagined as a country-side windmill area, but keep the homeworld palette loyal to the original. 3. Dark Hallow theme needs more bass, like the original. 4. **Finish the beta version of Gnasty Gnorc**!  The one with the tougher platforming, enemies, and having to use the Flamekiss to damage Gnasty Gnorc. Revise the whole fight to be what it was intended, and finish the job! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCP0vrq8feY Frankly, I don't think anyone would complain if Gnasty Gnorc was just a bit tougher.	For the 4th point, they could probably do something like Crash 2 where you have to catch up and superflame Gnasty 3 times before the powerup runs out before the final phase. 
What are the differences between this and [Flask Mega-Tutorial ebook](https://learn.miguelgrinberg.com/)? Same author, similar number of pages and both published in March 2018.

humbly disagree. remember when there were 99 versions of mp3 players and everyone thought the path to adoption was larger hard drive space and better mp3 ripping tools and cheaper devices, when what was actually necessary was a stupid-simple expensive device that let the least technical people use an mp3-like format?  this is where crypto is right now. I can't stand Jobs but he got one very important thing right: The user interface *is* the product.  Mainstream adoption starts when it stops being complicated.	Steemit has a super user friendly interface.

I like the music, the art, and the flow. When the text comes on screen, it expands and then contracts and expands again making it really shaky. It looks like that's due to some tags, but the contracting is jittery noise. You might be able to get away with making the text sections shorter without the jitter. I like that you've included significant gameplay footage. It looks great. It's still a bit hard to understand. It would be nice to treat it like a tutorial. What's a single interaction look like? The first thing the player learns. Maybe it's bouncing around a corner. Show that, then expand a bit. You can definitely go over the player's head later in the video, but as a viewer I want to understand the basic premise then get wowed with all the cool stuff I could eventually do.	All fantastic points! I am for sure going to start with the basics on this next version. I sometimes forget that other people have no idea what they are looking at. Thanks for the great feedback!

I expect some longtime Chvrches fans are going to be disappointed when they hear this. Obviously music is subjective but giving people a warning it’s a different sound 	Not all of us longtime fans are hoping for Science + Visions part 2. This is way heavier than their normal stuff and I love it. 
Showering too much dries out your skin	Proof fa66ot
I got this too! I followed up saying I’d be comfortable with a lower amount but would like them to make me an offer based on the resources available. I sincerely don’t understand why they would not just counter our offers and give us all at least some clue where we stand. Feels like it inevitably creates more work for them to respond to our follow ups. 	That's pretty much the path I took. I said something along the lines of if you have an offer I'd like to hear it.
The stronger your muscles are the better. Period. Especially for us. That being said everyone has their limitations. Getting "ripped" is not just about weight bearing exercise but also about diet. Do you want to get ripped? It's not a bad goal! Speak to your doctor, do it safely. 	This.  I waited too long and cannot work out because of a vascular issue but should have been working out regularly before.

The fact that he is not defending himself saddens me. We, as Muslims, ***must*** learn (and use when necessary) self-defense. We are ***not*** part of a pacifist, show the other cheek, religion. Hindu extremists are on the rise, and Muslims (and Christians, by the way) are suffering. Inshallah our brothers and sisters across the world will be free of this evil, and achieve peace. Hindu VS Muslim (VS Sikh) violence in the Subcontinent reached incredibly high, terrible levels in the past - let us pray it doesn't again.	&gt; must learn (and use when necessary) self-defense. but mooooooozlims defending demselves are t'errists n sheeit 
I’ve been trying to find other new-ish people here and haven’t had much luck. Would you be interested in working with a small group to bounce investing ideas off of and share strategies with? 	Hi I’m new here too. I’m not sure the potential benefits of this but may be interested.

I'm a noob, but why does it say 0 trophies?	Sometimes replays don't display trophies. Sometimes they don't display banners. Replays are not perfect. 
Nope, I witnessed 2 of mine. Pretty normal	Thing here is that this is, of course, my sister giving birth. Having your brother be there is tabboo to some people.
Isn't this a little early since he is just about to start his 4th year? Wouldn't this normally be done next offseason?	No, teams have to make the choice in the offseason leading into the final non option year (4th) of the rookie contract. 
Mild rant but I felt like participating. Heading to a wedding this weekend. Haven't wore any of my dress shirts since I started working out regularly in January. Put the shirt on that I was hoping to wear last night to make sure I don't end up out of state with an outfit that doesn't fit. It fits okay if I don't intend to move. Reaching my arms out makes it a little tight in the back and squeezes my shoulders. I know large shirts will be too big especially in the length of the arms, but what am I supposed to do when a medium doesn't fit my shoulders/back? 	Go buy a large and then go pay a Tailor $7 to $15 to make it fit.
This is not a great solution, the city has unused land in or near urban centers they could re-purpose for assisted living facilities.  This cal trans property comes to mind and it already has 3 different camps so its not like the residents are unaware or not used to homeless people around. https://www.google.com/maps/@33.9800786,-118.4299848,861m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=en	I figured that place was part of the state protected wetland, no idea if cal trans is involved with that, if anything its fish and game and probably the dnr

I think it’s a terrific idea, it’ll work for just about anything that you want to keep track of. How long will it run off of its battery? I’ll watch for this to become available on the open market because I’ll assume by then most of your bugs have been worked out, but thank you for building this and I think it’s a wonderful idea.	Yeah I can even see it being used on a sea-doo, ski-doo, quads, etc. Right now when it goes into low power mode it lasts around a week.
It will be this way forever until we find a way to move past a two-party system to something more like a "no-party" system in which candidates just run unaffiliated based on their policy platforms. The word "tribalism" has become en vogue recently, but even that term doesn't do it justice.	So never.

Telling someone your kinks and slowly corrupting them into liking it too. It's unreal how good it can be.	Or just figuring out what another person likes in bed without them telling you.

Pretty weird how these articles say the same thing several times in a row. They start with a bit of info and then repeat it. This way you get the same info twice. It's weird how these articles say the same thing several times in a row. They also repeat the same sentences, as well as info. Info, which is often duplicated multiple times throughout one single article.	A result of minimum number of words in students work being a large portion of the overall score.

I don't like the taste and it takes too much for it to be worth doing. I drank nearly a full handle of rum at a party and really didn't feel much different. I felt like I had a headache and that's it.	You have an insanely high tolerance or that wasn't rum lol.

Just because I'm reminiscing, here's sort of a spoiler-free cutscene from the game.

Radiohead-In Rainbows	Their best album in my opinion. So consistently beautiful 
Very nice stuff, Miroko. Only thing I would maybe change is the duration of the guild buff and make it last a little bit longer, so you don't constantly have the situation that you have only 10 (or so) minutes left and have to wait it out till starting something up.	Yes it could work with longer duration, the reason I suggested only 3 hours is to have the need to constantly spend credits and make credits relevant. But increasing the credits cost and duration would work too.
Unfortunately, it looks like you're trying to take on an impossible task.  An open loft above a common area is always going to have sound. Your options are talking to them, switching rooms, or moving out.  I'm not sure about your situation, however there are VERY few reasons why you would ever be stuck living there until next year.  You can sublease your room, you can pay to break a lease, or you can double pay for 2 places. If you have the money, just do option 3.  If money is an issue, consider taking a loan or borrowing the money since your mental health is more important than $1000 to break a lease. In the short term, ear plugs, music, and voicing your concerns are the only viable options.	It's highly doubtful breaking a lease would be anywhere near that cheap.
Does your nodulosa need a lot more light than other echeveria in order to prevent stretching out? I have one and it’s the only one that keeps getting a bit leggy, so I was wondering if it’s just me or not 	Unfortunately I don’t seem to get enough light for most of my plants, but grow lights will be on the way to fix that.

Gym teacher had a hidden camera for years in the girls locker room placed inside a washer with a do not open sign (for whatever reason nobody ever opened it). A student that cut his grass decided to snoop in his house while the teacher wasn't home. He came across tapes named "last look 03" and other names of that nature.  Popped one into the vcr and saw the girls from our school on the tapes.  It made some big news as this teacher was well respected especially as a track and football coach. Edit: washer=washing machine	The kid reported him, but not before making copies of his own. He walked down the halls with his eyes wide open from that day forward. 
24 hours of Lemons? Edit: Found a video of it in action! https://youtu.be/-JX9aGHKiSk 	I love it that was my first thought too. I mis the original 24 of lemons when you got to wreck the people's choice car.

Its at 475sats on the website now... The safex.io website is currently a mess with misleading pricing information, something thats been ignored for MONTHS. Its unacceptable Dan has let it sit in its current state for so long. I still hold some Safex but I've had to sell a big chunk of my holdings at cost price to reduce my exposure. Hoping this project sees some good progress soon, but the fact that the team cant keep a basic website running makes me wonder if they can handle an online marketplace with $500,000,000+ in trading volume? We will know soon™ 	I'm not too worried about the price or volume on the site. I'm just curious about where the money is going and why it isn't going through an exchange like last time. 
The fact they keep teasing a team break up leads me to believe it will happen. Not sure who though. Cesaro/Sheamus are the only ones who come to mind. An even bigger swerve would be New Day.	New Day would be nice tbh. They could move Big E and give him a solo push
Eat it out.	That's what she said
Large movements in numbers this week, +/- 7 between the Liberals and Conservatives hasn't been seen since New Years, nor have CPC numbers been this low, and conversely LPC numbers been this high since then either. While a Liberal jump as a result of the pipeline issue is certainly possible, the sub-categories are unhelpful determining where that change takes place. For example, in the 30-39 category, clearly is dealing with a small sample size, as it would require CPC support to have fallen to -16% over this past for the average to work out, which is not possible without results being demographically weighted. This also is a good reason for why myself and Eric Grenier only use every 4th Nanos result in our respective poll averages, 4 weeks ago, the Conservatives were polling at their second highest levels all year. 	No detailed tables, but plugged into the poll simulator and the rolling average, we're again looking at a razor-thin Liberal majority. LCNGB 174 - 130 - 33 - 1 - 0

My first exposure to Persona was the P3 movie. It's bizzaro. You watch all the other characters in the movie act like characters, but the protagonist is just an empty void. He stands there in scenes waiting for a player to project themselves onto him, but he's in a movie.	I think the point of his character in that movie was that he's creepy and not very likable.

And this is why I always spend the extra time with the CMF sets so that I get doubles of the costumed characters. I plan on doing the same thing.  We'll call it a "Mascot Convention," but deep down, we know the truth!	I am forever buying doubles! I have framed sets and doubles of the ones I like and find would be used in good photos! We certainly know the truth! 
I've chatted with guys, usually acquaintances at a party/bar/get together, who get angry and offended if they find out I'm not single or not looking to go home with them. Even if it's basic small talk or we're chatting as a part of group and there's zero flirting involved, you're treated like you're intentionally leading them on or wasting their time when all you did was talk about work or the weather. Hey, you asked if I was interested and I immediately set the story straight	Player move is to accept it and make friends.  Maybe she has friends tooooo Plus you have a new friend

You skipped an era, for some of us of a different age. Vinyl actually gave way to Cassettes for me, which then progressed to CDs, then Digital - now back to Vinyl and, believe it or not, Cassettes again.

The game's definitely not underrated - I'd actually say it's overrated. 83% on Metacritic is far too high considering how bad its handling gets with fast cars. The rest of it is better than any other track-focused racing game I can think of, it's just completely let down by the fact that you can't stop your car going sideways once you get above like 300 hp. Shift 2 has much better handling and expands a lot on the upgrading and tuning, but it dropped the progression system from Shift and is a lot less interesting because of it.	&gt;Shift 2 has much better handling username checks out
You're really gorgeous actually! Break ups can be hard, They obviously didn't see what they had, but someone will come sweep you off you're feet and see what they have.

Ask for a title change at the same pay for now. That increase your value on paper when you start looking. If things improve, you can ask for your salary to match the title change.	This.

The wires to the headset are quite thin, you can accidentally bend them too much causing the connection is cut off, which in then cause the display to turn off or blink. Happens to me a few times until I realize it got tangled too much.   My fix is to disconnect from the cable after each use.  	mine get very tangled too. I think untangling them caused some sort of disconnection. Disconnecting after every use prevents them from tangling?

I go off power to weight. Divide the weight by 10 and it gives you a good power to weight ratio that is more than enough to pass most cars. It's definitely enough to get in trouble with. Example: 3000lbs / 10 = 300hp car.	I break this rule just fine. It varries.

My girl Jane just got her dental cleaning today too! My favorite vet techs were working today, so I felt a little better after I dropped her off.

We're doing a good thing for our girls!	I was just called and told the exact same thing. What a relief! How often do we have to do this?
I'll add my complaint that it's impossible to see number of bots on small resolutions, and pressing L doesn't solve that. I play windowed because of performance issues (fullscreen halves my fps) and I have to switch to be able to read stuff. Lack of dynamic resolution is also a turn off, there are ways to change resolutions without exclusive fullscreen :/	The L windows has a members tab which also shows robots.
What's the download size of this game?  I read over 40GB but I'm downloading now and it's around 11.5GB.  Is that just to load up the first part of the game for midnight launch then it will automatically do the rest?  It's been forever since I preordered/downloaded a PS4 game so I don't remember.	I think that 11GB is what you need at least to start playing. Once it finishes downloading that it should begin downloading the rest, regardless of the time.

It would take some work, that's not a standard layout. Custom mounting and i/o at the minimum. Almost certainly custom fan mounting required as well, older cases are terrible for cooling. Easiest way forward would be a microatx or itx board and a dremel with a a whole lot of cutting discs.	^ Think it would take a lot of work, but you could make something out of that case. Mobo tray from another machine, remove the drive cages, mount the power supply up top you could make into something. 
Nope. Aftermarket exhaust won't void any warranty. if there is a failure somewhere in the car, they need to prove that the aftermarket exhaust was the cause for the problem, which in 99% of cases it just isnt.	Awesome! Thanks for the info
For four years I have waited to see the Steelers play the Saints in New Orleans. What does the NFL do, schedule the game 2 days before Christmas FML!!!!	Sounds like a good Christmas present
Supposedly it helps the camera focus. I did it in some of mine and it seems to maybe help, a little bit. I think it’s maybe a bit catty to suggest it’s for bragging about being married or showing off a ring....while I’m sure that happens, I’m  not even married/didn’t use an engagement ring or anything and I’ve seen plenty of women use costume jewelry. I’m sure some are just trying to get the camera to focus and some are probably just doing it because they see others do it 	Well, I'm not going to lie, I liked that I'd be able to show off my ring a bit when I tried it lol. It's not terribly ostentatious but I love it so.
Hand signals would probably work too. As long as that person knows what he wants them to do, they’ll do it. But I guess if they were deaf they could close their eyes to avoid getting controlled but then they couldn’t take him down.	Get me Helen Keller. 
Pictures are always helpful, but from your description it sounds like a misadjustment has caused some premature wear on the chainring and it is now skipping as you have experienced. Does it happen in all gears? Or just one?	https://youtu.be/o7yCEtoMGsk Here is a video of it - now that I have seen it it looks like it pops off after the master link goes through the smaller gear. If I push that smaller cog away from the bike a little it doesn’t pop off. Is that adjustable ?

Start with single arm dumbbell rows (knee on a bench), and target 8-12 reps.  Another exercise to try is trap bar rows (you are able to get a better contraction). In general, even with the regular barbell rows, target lower weight with higher reps. High reps will help you feel the contraction.	Will consider doing this. Do I have to do this in place of the barbell rows for time being until I learn the contractions in my back? If so, do I keep this 5 sets while doing the adjusted rep range?

Does anyone know the deal with the zebra?  It looks like it isn’t a part of his normal stage set up.	He kissed it on the head. Epic memory for life
Offsides, and I'm pretty sure the faceoff would be in your zone regardless	Yup. It'd be offside, and since the puck came from your own zone, the faceoff would go there. It's actually a smart play, as you'd get the ability to change your lines here, whereas icing wouldn't allow for it.
Do you mean this one? https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0P2Oz15enirXkC2-4e8fWpevSsRp23rG Or this one? https://youtu.be/Wuxc0z3LLs8	Ive seen the 2nd one and its really good
Who is in the Pace Car today? Sarah or Oriol?	They said Servia earlier
I don't know what this poem is about. There are no real images in it, so there is nothing for my attention to grab on to. I don't know who's speaking or who they're speaking to. The structure of these lines is all about yearning, but this doesn't tell me anything about what love means to the speaker. If making your lines rhyme means using cliche images that slide off the mind ("embrace" "smile" "dove") then don't rhyme and try to find music in the language elsewhere. It's clear that you care about this poem, but you aren't giving the reader any reason to finish it. Feel free to message me if you have any questions. Good luck	Excellent feedback, will take this into consideration. ☺️👍

I love how all three duos are Spurs duos	I like that part too
It's great to see and all, but Scott looks like he got hit harder than anyone in that exchange. 	Yeah he looked like he was out cold
This place was great but Rooster Republic in Santa Ana had the better chicken. Plus, no wait!	Thanks for the tip. I still haven’t tried Howlin Rays since the idea of spending 2 hours in line for fried chicken sounds insane (but delicious).
:(	 Please tell me your flair is informed by something mx funko said in the rant against rpdrcringe McCarthyism 
The map is amazing...but it needs scavs. It is too empty at the moment and since there are no scavs, it is usually just hatchlings running about.	I reckon they should not add scavs to the map until it's fixed but instead up player count. 
I used to be quite vocal. I no longer am. It stays off social media. That sort of thing. In private conversation with friends...I'm more open. I would be considered an extremist by most peoples assessments. 	You can't be an extremist with a username like that!

Don’t push through that. It looks like an allergic reaction. Definitely call your doc. 	 I currently have no insurance so can’t see the doctor. I’m gonna have to stop using it I guess. This seemed like my final hope for some type of treatment. I already tried finacea, elidel and diet change and none worked. Elidel did more harm than good

I'm a part time college student and my wife makes cufflinks from hemp.  We can't go over 5.2 million...	Oh man we are really going to have to work to get everything they need in this budget.
Don't evolve him yet. If you didn't do the special new research 	I think you’re too late lol
From my experience with geese those safety precautions are more likely to be for the pedestrians than for the goose.	Very true. I once walked on a path, and (apparently) there was a nest nearby. A momma goose started hissing at me. I had no idea they could even do that...
Health insurance. Deductibles, copay, cafeteria plans, FSA. Seriously, every time I have to choose this stuff, I have to have it explained to me on a 3rd grade level. It's pathetic. 	They are really complicated and that’s why there are people that are paid to do it.
I downloaded this and there no ebook. If anyone has the ebook please post a link here. Thanks!	Check the folder again. Its both in there(mp3 and epub) 
If I made that mug my mom would say that it is because it takes one to make one. She's certain that I am a corrupt demon. Congrats on the ridiculously awesome project, and on the mother's love.	Reminds me of when I had to explain to mom that my little bro isn't a satanist(drew pentagrams everywhere)
Wait till you try the 698!	I have it, I love it! My most recent purchase
I need to buy this pattern but make them into shorts. 	theres a shorts option as well as a long sleeve option. I altered it a bit, instead of using a zipper fly, I made it into an elastic waist because I find that easier and more comfortable when i'm working. 
Accidental instances of minor physical pain. For example: bumping my head on an opened cupboard door, stubbing my toe on the corner of my bed frame, tripping over a raised part of my rug. The rage I feel during these experiences is the most extreme rage I've ever felt in my life.	Stubbing my little TOE! 
Prevail Union. https://www.prevail.coffee/locations/	Seconded
Hold shift I mean me too thanks	never works for me in paint, i mean haha, yes
I imagine a similar pattern would appear for most photos that have any post-processing, got to get that high-contrast blue and orange!	My initial assumption was that it meant the two most common environments they photographed were the ocean and deserts.

You are either going to have to find a therapist and start working on your issues or find a way to tell him that you have some problems with what he's sharing, that you have traumas in your past that he's triggering. 	Ok thank you
Also , if they had mirrors that made people look shorter and fatter would that not discourage people from buying their clothes? 	Came here to say this. Virtually all clothing store mirrors make people look taller and skinnier. 
Recently proposed to my girlfriend of 5 years and she said yes!!!!	5 years ago, I asked out my true love. Today, I proposed to her. She said no both times
Your idea or theirs? Where's the 'design'element? Very cool indeed!	The 'design' is in the thinking.

Whatever happened to the requirement of parents sitting in on any questioning of a minor by LEOs?  His other rights should've afforded him protection from this.  	Is he not 18?

Since we had a Cookie Monster reference in here, I’m going to need a Sesame Street/Muppet mock draft. 1) Kermit I’ve traded back in to get two picks for staddler and waldorf 	Guise, is this what we've become? Is this what we have been reduced to? On the eve of the biggest day in Cleveland sports history we are doing Muppet mocks?
In what way is Monogatari like Oregairu? I don't see it lol Monogatari is pretty unique.. the closest you'll get really is similar in it's art or directing. There are a lot of moments in KareKano that I thought were like Monogatari in the directing department.	Hachiman can be compared to Araragi in quite a few ways. I also got Oregairu vibes from Monogatari due to the quality of the character writing all around  (not just restricted to the MC)
Had that same issue every night. I disabled the iCloud backup and it seems to be working fine now.	I will try that tonight. We will see
This reads like bad fanfic.	Because it is.
Have you reported it? This is the first I've heard about it. 	They routinely get reported because they also try to doxx people, especially mods at r/canada who are opposed to them. But nothing is done.

If that's the logic then let's just say poor folks should just earn more money.  Simple.  See, nothing to it.  Problem solved. /s just in case.	No no no no. If poor people make more money, then everyone *above* them has to make more money. And the prices of life's necessities have to go up. That's the only way the system works in Donaldland.
Am I the only one that realizes that this is a mag safe connector. The ones you charge macbooks with. 	It certainly looks like it! Good eye.

Try running with the `-force-glcore` command-line option. (In Steam: right-click-&gt;Properties-&gt;Set Launch Options...) This worked for me on Windows 10, on my Surface Pro 2. If that doesn't work, try other [Unity Standalone Player command-line options](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html). *(Update: This doesn't exactly fix it... I can get through the opening cutscenes and character creation, but all of the textures are missing once a mission starts.)*	Similarly, I made it through all that but then it crashed once I selected "new game" in the loading screen What about Unity? Did that work for you?
That's very creative, it kinda reminds me of a helicoprion.	That's actualy exactly what it was based off. I was also intending on making one with this mouth style.

Bigger Pockets. There are something like 270 episodes so far, each at least an hour long so you can be sure to find one on the topic you're interested in.	Seconded. Just getting started, love their channel.
I actually think playing Tracist on her would have been better than that.	Without Seagull on Junkrat they would have lost even faster.
.04 sats this year 	hope you are right !
How tall was giant Dinklage?	More than twice as tall as Thor.
I suffer from this feeling roughly around the 6 month mark on any job i have. 	Same!
I assume you’re on the north side of 270?	Just barely Double Tree by Hilton 270 &amp; 28 
I voted T just to insult this man's legacy.  Turned out to be a fantastic decision.	Best decision of anyone’s life. 
John Wall is carrying the Wizards I don't wanna hear anyone say otherwise	He's been the only guys who's shown up every game this series. Our team forgets how to play basketball on the road it's so frustrating. 
Wolverine - I really like the character, I had an excellent DoFP skin for him and yet I couldn't force myself to play him. He was just your average melee character without anything particularily interesting.	The thing with Wolverine is that he was super disappointing. You would think that the most popular X-man would have a more exciting kit, but he was just meh.
Put in the same amount of effort that I do.  Plan dates, pay for them, make decisions, etc.	I went on a date last week he payed for the games at Dave and busters and i tried to pay for dinner but he wouldn’t let me. I always offer to at least split the bill. 
The only time I took my bike in to a mechanic was to replace the fork seals. It seemed like too much hassle to buy all the proper tools. 	I've rebuilt a bunch of forks and never bought any specialty tools, a lot of people go overboard with what is "required" to do them.
Bill Cosby just got found guilty	Lol just saw he lashed out at the prosecutors. 
No excuses!	NOT EVEN THIS ONE

They did everyone else dirty by putting Monet, Eureka, and Kameron first	By the looks of it, Eureka's team could be an after Untucked and still be better than the other two teams.
That save on Connelly was grand larceny	That is actually the second time Murray made that same style of save. I was watching the replay on dtmts.com and he had one earlier in the first.

Denton, TX represent	Same here!
I use the jar thing from that guide and a dropper. Whatever you use just make sure it’s an exact measurement. I use distilled water too. The taste of vodka at 8am isn’t a good thing despite what some guides say. Carefully monitor your mood over the month and see how you are impacted by the dosing. Adjust as required. I’ve never gone above 10ug tho. 	Thanks, yeah I'm going with distilled water, too. Can't be going to work on drugs and alcohol! What ug did you start with initially?
Too bad the Ares Convention prevents you from doing it the only way to be sure. :P	Blake wills it

Do you get to pick from a litter or is the dog already chosen? If you get to pick then. Get the one that is not first into everything but also not the one that is last to things. Put a plush animal toy with the puppies and don't get the one that is first to wrestle the toy but the one that comes second or third and explores more gently.	Do they tend to be chewers do you know? 
Why can’t you do both??	&gt; Why can’t you do both?? Yeah, why *can't* I do both?! &gt; Looks in mirror &gt; Remembers what I'm like to be around Oh, right... that's why...
of course, and for support there is also /r/BodyAcceptance 	I'm holding out for them to just go away as I keep losing weight- it's hard to accept it when there's a light at the end of the tunnel. I guess we'll see if the light is real or not
Get your hands wet, apply soap, clean hands outside of water, rinse soap off hands. Is this something that people struggle with?	I just heard someone in the bathroom apply soap, smear it around their hands, then turn the water on and wash off the soap. Don't ask. The idea of putting soap on my hands before water makes me uncomfortable. Seems like people do it both ways.

I'm confused... that process tells us nothing about the primers, which is what he referenced as a likely problem.  Did I miss something?	Visuals? Hard to detect smaller imperfections, but bigger ones would be visible. And/or also run a finger over the back to detect primer not seated.

Watching as well. My 11 yr old said, “it’s a lot slower than the Pens’ games.” I though that as well. What do others think? I’m surprised by this as I haven’t watched much of either team this season but all I’d heard was they were fast and big. 	We're faster than the Jets for sure.  but this is a fast game.
meanwhile if you hop in il2....	I'm not familiar with the situation in IL-2, what's it like when it comes to finding servers?
1. The only way to know is to ask for an ID. Given the nature of your business with her, baka hindi ka niya bigyan. If you think it's sketchy then don't do it. 2. As long as you're not paying her and shes 18+ you have nothing to worry about. 3. If may singaw ka it's possible. 4. Sa public place muna kayo magmeet. Always use protection.	&gt; cam She was able to provide me her ID and yes she's more than 18 and she was able to provide me with more pictures. And yes it is a paid service.
More specifically it's detecting capacitance, which is a property that most bags of meaty water are going to have.  The trick is that wet wood can also trigger the mechanism, leading to a surprising and mildly\-expensive end to your cut.  The system can be disabled if you're dealing with high\-moisture\-content stock.	Also gets triggered on insulated styrofoam since it has aluminum foil, and carbon fiber (which is conductive).
well guess it's time to watch shinkalion then	Do it! It's a terribly undiscovered show.
Are you asking if it's possible to calculate an angle θ if you know sin(θ)? Yes. The function you want is called "arcsin". Or sometimes "sin^(-1)".	I'd use ArcSine if I want to calculate the angle of one side of a triangle ?
What about our reflection on water or shiny metal objects?	I thought of that but they're very rarely the same as a mirror or camera 
My INFJ ex was warm and lovely and thoughtful, but it took forever to open him up. And then once he opened up, he freaked out and broke up \(when I thought things were going well!\). I think INFJs can be overly dramatic, esp when dealing with baggage. You guys are not good at asking for help from others. Question though\-\- do INFJs do casual flings or hook ups? My guess is not really, based on my INFJ friends, but I can't tell if INFJs are likely to "play the field" the way other \(T\-type, emotionally stunted...\) MBTI types do?	We actually do. Myself and all the infjs I know have casual relationships sometimes. 
Genuinely an incredible achievement for the club, we may have come close in recent seasons but with how thin our squad usually was we always came up short, so this really is a big step up for the club. I guarentee that we probably will keep signing free's in the summer, realistically we gotta give all that promotion prize winning money to Ainsworth's bonus so he doesn't leave	Always a great game when we got to play you, enjoy league 1, we might be able to join you again soon!
The only similarity is the hair color. 	The fact that they both look like the other's sibling.

I like the picks, lol. but i find it kind of funny that when I imagine pro bowl players or HOF'ers their names are more like our top 3 picks than the last two, like some kind of nominative determinism, lol	I feel like if we are going off names alone then Durham Smythe is for sure a HOF lock
Good job editing the Sbubby poster	I know, It sounds so ridiculous
Pulling your goalie down three with six minutes left? It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.	I had looked down at my phone, then looked up after the goal and was absolutely confused about why the net was empty.

I’m down for some conversation; my night isn’t much more exciting. Finally got home so I’m cuddling with my puppy after not seeing him all day	Awww what kind of puppy do you have? 
Congratulations! So what did you end up with for a degree?	Sign Language studies with a minor in Psychology. Finishing with another degree in Interpreting within the next year. 
oh wow nice, i saw one at the college point one earlier	Yeah these are not going to sell out so fast. 
Still need a Ryan Shazier replacement at ILB. I actually mostly agreed with the Steelers on the position, outside of maybe wanting them to take Shaun Dion Hamilton in the 5th.  I didn't really like the options available where we were picking.  Sometimes, the board just doesn't match up with your needs.	Any chance you guys have a decent backup Guard? The Panthers have a good backup ILB in David Mayo and just drafted two more ILB. A trade there could make sense. 
It's going to be verrry interesting to watch those guys fight for the starting job.	My bold prediction right now is that Lauletta wins the #2 job and Webb is either released or placed as the #3 QB. Probably more likely the #3.     
'Doing it for the exposure,' the evergreen classic of exploitation. 'It's so confusing. We're just trying to figure out this young medium.' Finger-kissing good.	&gt; It's so confusing (amoral liberal) I just don't know what to believe anymore!

-you're always "antagonizing/villifying/attacking" them no matter what -when they apologize it's more like "I'm sorry you reacted that way but I was doing nothing wrong and you hurt me much more" -you have to walk on eggshells around them because anything can be used against you. they'll dig through your words to find something to get upset about -theyre very two faced and try to turn your friends against you -they never do anything wrong, they were always doing it for "your sake" even if they were being selfish and abusive no I'm not bitter what are you talking about 	I can sympathize

Man, I would really love to see some pictures of the actual wood cuts and your process! These are awesome. I'd be interested in trying it. 	Well I can post some pics of the boards tonight!

New driver here! Quick question: when turning left from a minor road to a major road with two lanes, without traffic lights, do I have to wait till BOTH lanes are clear before moving off, or is it alright if I move off after the leftmost lane is clear, but there are still cars moving on the right lane?	By right according to driving test standard, wait for both lanes to clear.

After using all the sauce out of the spaghetti sauce jar add a little water and put the lid back on, shake it a bit then pour the remaining water and sauce to your dish. But don't use too much water!	Or just [make your own sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/09/how-to-make-rich-hearty-italian-american-red-sauce-one-hour-or-less.html).  It'll be way better than anything you're ever going to find in a jar.

She still works at the Asian bar....	I was there one night and asked my waitress if Portia still works there. She shook her head, walked away, and another waitress served me the rest of the night. They're still not happy about the callers lol
Nope... mostly because it’s probably too big to comment, to early in the dev cycle to confirm what they want to do is possible. Or because it’s like a cafe... you make the same money from the takeaway order that’s there thirty seconds as the family that’s there for an hour. So which will you focus your motivation on to keep going....?	It's not too early in the dev cycle. They've been saying for months that they're working on it. If that's too early then something is wrong.

[This Broken Shovel "challenge" is tough as nails.](/spoiler)	I just pressed  R until I got Pyromaniac in the first treasure room.
So this is a savory waffle with grated cheddar cheese and green onions folded into the batter. As well as a little garlic salt and pepper. The “fried” chicken was dredged by putting it in an egg white/sriracha mixture and then into seasoned breadcrumbs. Sprayed the cookie sheet with oil spray, then a little more on top of the chicken. Cooked 10 mins at 425, flip, cook 8 minutes more. The sauce I ended up making was random but came out really delicious. Couple tablespoons honey, couple tablespoons maple syrup, one tablespoon each of soya sauce and sriracha. And some garlic. I let that simmer together and reduce while the chicken cooked. Spicy sweet and yummy. One waffle and two pieces of chicken, with 2Tbps of sauce was 550 calories. 	It’s my favorite when the picture looks like a ton of calories and then it’s not, it looks so good 
run forest run	The bee movie?
Opinion on The Who and more specifically Pete Townshend 	He has a great feel for open chord riff writing.
When is the AMA?	Apparently never? I was wondering the same thing and kept checking back for updates. Did this fall through? 
I wonder how long we have to wait until attendance picks up for Arizona teams. I know we have to wait for kids who grew up with the team to get old enough to buy tickets and go to games, but I'm impatient. 	The Suns used to sell out. You pretty much have to be good for an extended period. 
LMC 3403	Is it a computer science paper or more of a media &amp; technology paper? 
Spoiler Alert	For what movie?
(So this turned unsettling)	(Turned? But seriously why does he use parenthesises around all those messages?)
Me too, I've been waiting for this quite sometime now. BTW,  have you added the Accessibility option to your quick menu? 	Yeah i did, and i know it is not hard to do, but Still.. i switch game very often. It gets irritating
I think people just don't say anything unless they're good friends.  I remember getting a dramatic haircut and no one at work said a thing.  I'm pretty friendly with my co\-workers but only my kids said anything about it.  	I feel like it's pretty safe to comment on a haircut.
I'm a geologist, I've definitely incorporated geology into my magic systems. I've also drawn on my experiences working in remote camps as a setting for a novel. (And I like to make sure my mountain ranges are geologically accurate.) 	Have you read geologist-cum-author Rick Bass? The way he describes a frozen lake in *The Hermit's Story* is surreal.
i ask the same man , do you have some info 	P.S. Have you noticed that the 24\-hour volume is HALF the market cap???
really depends on how much you rush it. It does have replay value though, as there is no linear story, its dynamic based on your community and play-style. From what I have seen today, I'm concluding you can rush it in a few hours, but, then you'll miss out on a lot of the game. Don't buy it if your just gonna play it once to finish it. You'll be disappointed.	I wanna play it fully do the side missions and main story ect ect, don't plan to rush. i would like to play online considering random strangers are any good to play with.
Didn't the teens win in the end every time?	But did 16 of them?

After all, a broken pencil is pointless.	That would be a dull conversation... 
Dude, you just copied the positives and left out all of the critic. Are you serious!?	No I did not. I copied the tagline in italics and the **conclusion paragraphs** in the quote. Are you seriously unable to read the articles and see that?
Moon Step, an ability from the popular manga/anime One Piece, allows the user to kick the air with such strength and speed that they are effectively floating. Flight for martials, anyone?	Not flight, air walk, still good :P
Reminds me of a project I came behind and cleaned up a few companies ago.  Management and most of the dev team were all about new projects and moving forward and the next generation of awesomeness, and I came behind them as the 'Continuous Improvement' guy who cleaned up the mess left behind and made things actually work. There was one release with a short deadline and they bit off way too much for it.  After a few delays the 28 year old director brought the team together and basically told them it was shipping in a week.  You can imagine how well that product launch went. 	&gt; You can imagine how well that product launch went. I think you're going to have to regale us with this one.
I, Robot. Fun action film. Will Smith is there. What's wrong with that?	For me the product placement just sounded too stupid, that was what really put me off it.

Wishlist Dior J'adore Huile Divine. I am wondering if this is better than EDP. But has the same rose note. Becca Backlight primer. I am looking for something I can wear on no makeup days without foundation. Essence Gel pencil. I am looking for something that stays on my waterline. Dior Magnify eyeshadow palette. So I mentioned last week I was looking for purple eyeshadows. Is this worth it? 	The Essence pencil is super creamy and pigmented but it transferred really badly on me. It also broke within the month, even though I was pretty careful with it. 
I'm sorry the picture isn't very good, what are the tall dark pink flowers?	Looks like https://app.gardenanswers.com/share/5212602833567744

It use to evolve from turtle but then nobody would play as lionfish cause it would only evolve into one tier 10.	Then we place some more options that make more sense, not specifically in realism but in gameplay. 
Seeing your recent losses, and having been baited on a reactive-fit nano nomen of yours before, you seem to be someone who flies ships fit for very specific purposes. Could you share one of your best niche fits with us?	Ima Hit you with a meme I enjoyed, the nano Rail exeq navy once Im home
I'd like one if you've still got one to spare!	Pm'ed you!
Yeah, I'm pretty sure a "HAMMER DOWN!" didn't go off for me once, even though my team heard it. Almost lost the match because of it.	Here's a nice video of the same happening to me. Only was able to catch it because I was watching hard for it. You are not alone. https://streamable.com/vxq61

Check if it set to shut down after 30 mins in Power Managment ( Control Panel -&gt; Power options)	It's not indentical periods of time; it varies, and it's usually in use when it occurs.
I think this got a patch to help with performance.	It's much better now. The loading of new areas still makes the framerate drop, but it's not as noticeable as it used to be. It's actually playable now, and the tech problems don't distract from the actual experience \(unless you're LOOKING for flaws\).
If Wal-Mart can't staff these service departments %100 they need to get rid of them. 	Half the time I have jewelry, fitting room, and sporting goods keys because we don’t have an associate covering any of them.

Out of curiosity, do the producers have collective bargaining rights? Granted, they were all freelancers, basically, but I feel like the next step for internet workers would be to unionize. 	Holly talked about getting a Creator Union started but I think the idea fell through.
*paid The amount quoted is for 6 hours. Standard Tuesday nights are 3 hours. Weekends are typically 2x6 hours. There are allowances for going out to the field and other things. I can’t recall off the top of my head. I don’t know if I would call it a salary. It’s more like pocket money.	Cheers mate

It's a bit of a stretch, but if the star-host harbors gluttony or greed they might actually be what Maggie needs. Think about it: Gil's got these "holier-than-thou" episodes that he goes through, which always result in Maggie trying to be someone she's not. Meanwhile, someone greedy or gluttonous might take on more of a "treat yo' self" attitude. Where Maggie finds rejection in Gil, she might find acceptance in the star-host. Unfortunately, Maggie has terrible judgement.	Idk, I'd call it foreshadowing that they're going to at least have some form of connection. It seems like a very deliberate detail that's been missed by most and would love to see what happens.

It's a point cloud marker. Someone is going to come through with special cameras and take bunch of photos that go into computer software that turns those images into a 3D model of the building. These markers are used by the software to know how to overlay the various images and create the point cloud / 3D model.	That was such an informative answer. Makes me curious about the purpose of the 3D model. Could it be about connecting 30th Street Station to the 30th St El station?

Based on the "Is it CG?" ingredient checker: [http://isitcg.herokuapp.com/](http://isitcg.herokuapp.com/) I was able to categorize all my existing products.This was especially helpful to determine which shampoos contain sulfates to clarify existing buildup without adding more silicones back in. I also found that I had more CG friendly shampoos and styling products than I thought. Yay saving money! Of course a few products gave me warnings for protein and humectants, but overall if they passed, they passed. I made sure I kept the categories separate in my bathroom and shower, since I'm not ready to part with all the bad product yet. If you think I have any products in the wrong categories, please let me know! Want to be sure I can trust the igredient checker. 	Protein is not bad, you just need moisture with it. Good that you’re being mindful about using something clarifying for build up.
Does uniqlo usually restock their shirts?	Not usually but this might be an exception since it went out so fast. They usually restock like one or two times but after a while they completely remove them from their site.

Just ignore them.  Say "Yes mom, I'm sorry mom" and just leave it at that. Know that you are special and have your own talents. We all make mistakes in life. It's important you cut off the negativity and not dwell on it, and then move on in life. Once you do great things in life and make your mark in the world, then see what they say.	If only you could follow your own advice and own up to your own incompetence instead of trying to weasel your way through life

&gt;Options with regards to pitch control were very limited or even totally absent One of the great things about using software to DJ is the fact you can tone lock the songs. If you have one originally at 120bpm but you need it at 130 you can speed it up without the vocals also being pitched up and vice versa. I’m not sure if or where DJay has that option but definitely make sure that’s turned on for mashing up songs with vocals. 	Click on the little note symbol next to the pitch slider in the software. It’ll turn blue, which means key lock is on.
I think your public health experience will help you craft a unique story, and you check all the boxes for research experience, volunteering, etc if you include your scribing stuff you're starting. LORs seem solid. Stat-wise, your numbers are very similar to what mine were. Use MSAR to find places where your MCAT is between the 25th and 75th percentiles and go from there. What class size/curriculum/rotations/research opportunities do you want? For example, U Cincinnati has a great reputation in peds, check them out! Their median matches your MCAT. Include your state schools, and throw in some reaches if you want, I think your app will really stand out!	Thanks for your input! I appreciate it!

cool! how did you get the ground texture to not look repetitive?	I blended a curvature and noise node in Redshift to mask out areas for another texture. I think the camera angle and displacement help make it look not so repetitive as well.

I mean, if you in there studying for hours I'ma trust you more than everyone that could possibly walk in there.

This is what I thought, but then I tried to get a comparable arrangement from a local florist, and I couldn't find one. Everything was much more expensive, which didn't make sense.	It's because FTD and other flower order sites have unrealistic pictures of what is being sold. The flower shop can make it nice for you but if they try to make it like FTD then the flower shop loses money.

Every time I see articles like this my first thought is all the lush lawns across the valley. It's really idiotic to was water on grass that should not exist. 	We just got artificial grass! Woohoo! Now I have the satisfaction of lush greenery with zero guilt of mismanaging water resources. ..except maybe those occasional long showers.
Don't forget you need to maintain proper diet. Less carbs and fat, a little more protein, good nutrition. I'm not shredded by any means, but since starting since Winter Quarter as well, I definitely have some definition back thanks to doing both a lot of cardio and lifting at the same time. 	Depends. Fats are actually good if you eat the right ones and keep you fuller than proteins/carbs. 
will Corbin, Sterling Marte for Kluber and Deshields be considered? i dont want to insult him	He'll probably reject it, but it's not insulting.

N.K. Jemisin’s books. 	Having just finished the Broken Earth series I'm not sure 'happy' is the word for that ending. 'Sad' isn't quite right either, but neither is 'happy'. 
Cackling at all the salty souls in here. Sure, winning 5 comps is impressive but at the end of the day Big Brother is a social game. If you can maneuver your way to the end without needing HOH or Veto then you are doing something right. It wasn't flawless, but Paras' game is certainly deserving of the win. 	So with that logic Will and Maddy should have won then. Got it.

&gt; she found out that she is pregnant. Even though she was taking the birth control pill *(what are the odds of that???)* at the time. Dude, seriously? You need to inform and involve yourself in your birth control method. The Pill is only 91% effective with typical use. 	Came down to the comments to see who else took note of that. The pill is not the most effective birth control out there. I’d be more surprised if she got pregnant with the implant or an iud. 
Im surprised you didnt put gozuki, kots, saffira up there because those are the 3 im considering the hardest. Ill probably go saffira	I was going to but I wanted to go with a more flexible pick. But those three are very good for their respective decks

This is a rough calculation: it is suggested to treat cats when they had &gt;40mg/kg of theobromine, which for your cat (say she‘s 2.5kg) would be more than 100mg/kg. Super dark chocolate (90% cocoa) contains 26 mg/g of theobromine. So if your cat really just had the tiniest amount she should be fine (i am assuming the chocolate was less than 90%). Excitations/nervousness can be symptoms of intoxication, but if you said this is her normal behavior/you didn‘t notice anything abnormal, i wouldn‘t be too worried. However: it would be ideal if you / someone were able to watch the cat for the next few hours for abnormal behaviour, to be on the safe side. 	Also in regards to the type of chocolate, I am unsure of how strong it is exactly, but it is a cheapo protein bar and tastes in between milk and dark chocolate, so I don't think it would have a high amount.
A big one for me is [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/). Makes it so easy to find big files visually and keep my hard drive free of big, pointless files.	There's a pretty good program called 'Folder Size' which literally just displays the size of folders in a little pop up box because Windows doesn't do it automatically 
From a behavior analysts viewpoint, the dog is the one providing the positive reinforcement to the officer - the officer does what the dog wants and the dog reinforces the officer’s behavior by getting into the car.

I think it's the other way around. 	May I ask why? I’ve tried reading a couple of runs, but they always required previous runs for reading and understanding the story, which just led to me giving up. But, I may have just been picking wrong comics to read.
It's all relative.  Not all players can be good at something because that just means "good" has lost all meaning. Also it's not about guys not running the right routes, it's about how well you run the routes.  If an NFL WR isn't running the right routes he won't be on the field. 	it does happen pretty frequently at the NFL level, especially with rookies. a lot of rookies coming into the league are instantly having to expand their route tree and play diagnosis well beyond what they've ever had to do and this leads to them running the wrong routes. 
That's awesome. How does the rope hold the weight though? 	Thanks! Well, we`re using it at home for books, papers, and other smaller stuff. It did carry the weight of 25 kg concrete, as long as you don`t put more than that would be ok, I guess.
This is changing recently though. Like if you are a male whose name rhymes with "maiden" I can be pretty sure you were born sometime in the first ten years of this century. I have no idea what has changed socially that has lead to this shift. It really interests me though, as names do generally.	...either that or you’re trans FTM! 
Becks non alcoholic isn’t terrible. It’s a favourite with pregnant women everywhere haha. Glad you found something that works for you and congrats on your sobriety. I have eliminated binge or party drinking in my life recently as well. I’ll still have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a cocktail when I’m out with friends. But that’s it. One, maybe two drinks over a very long evening maximum. Helps me be healthier mentally and physically. 	Awesome! I love to hear about anyone bettering themselves. Keep up the good work, and have a glass of nice wine for me :)

If we go even with Leverkusen on differential, it goes to head to head correct?	No, goals scored. 
I started my SE army yesterday with the soon old starting box (the one with the khorn guys aswell). Pretty hyped about the new one and i‘m hopping they will synergise well	Same with me, finishing the old starter and immediately getting the new one!

Improving for four years but still no luck? Ouch. Sounds like you need to improve your social circle. Easiest way to get a girl is when you have friends. It's becomes natural 	My status is low indeed. I have few friends also due to me having been in monk mode for a long time. That’s probably my problem, I need to meet more people. 
How did the punishment go Sara?	I haven't done any of them yet, during the maid course. They are a part of the punishment system, letting the academy use them whenever they want.

Beauty in chaos. Like you, I too was born and raised in Kathmandu and absolutely love it. People say it's dusty, noisy, polluted, corrupt, but when I walk the streets, I see none of that. I see it as a beautiful mess and absolutely love it. 	I'm surprised you don't notice the pollution and the dust.
Just went for a really long, hard run. It felt great. Still waiting on my overdue period and trying very hard to ignore social media, avoid restaurants, and anything else holiday-related. So far so good. Going to plant some things before acupuncture later today. Good luck to you all today ladies! Remember that tomorrow will be another regular day. 	Ohhh a run sounds great! Good for you. I just stood up to change into exercise clothes. Returned to my seat with a glass of wine instead.🤷🏻‍♀️
In Europe we had the Citreon DS3/DS4/DS5 etc. The DS spun off into its own brand. Abarth used to be a sub-group within Fiat with the cars being called Fiat Abarth Whatever. But now Abarth is a separate (wholly owned by FCA) subsidiary. In the opposite direction. The Audi Quattro used to be a separate car but now its kinda like a trim level	It's funny cause I sometimes hear people call their car an 'Audi Quattro' when it's just something like an A4 TDi Quattro... Likewise they'll say 'I drive a BMW M' when they mean a BMW 320d M-Sport
I don't get Ziggler's appeal. I particularly don't get why people still support him when he's shown no desire to change what isn't working.	An underrated factor in SDL's recent return to form is Ziggler going to Raw.
I doubt they will ever bring back og step ups tbh	How were the og step ups different than the ones now? I always took breaks during step ups so idk about them or how the og ones were better like everyone says. 
This has been me all week too. My mom basically abandoned me as a child and I spent my formative years with a n step-parent. First I thought I saw my dad’s n/ex while grocery shopping the other day and cried in the parking lot. Then, my roommates were watching Matilda. I love that movie, but it hits too close to home. This afternoon I’m working. I’m a tattoo artist and we’ve had so many people coming in for mother/daughter tattoos. I just can’t wait for this day to be over. Now, I’m celebrating Mother’s Day with my MIL. She is such a wonderful mom, but I just get so sad being around such a loving and functional family. 	That Matilda feeling... I know it well. 
Who even has the holy bible on their phones these days?	I do

Too lazy to find out to map out the whole song but from what I can tell after listening to it and messing around on my uke, it’s in the key of F and uses the following chords; F A7 (or just A) Dm Bb C7 (or you can just use C) The opening is somewhat like this (with each chord getting 4 beats): F   A7     Dm   Dm  Bb   A7    Dm    Dm Knowing the chords and the key, I’m sure you could experiment and figure out the rest of the song : ) 	Technical question and slightly off topic perhaps, but how do you figure out something is in the key of F?
How do you loop oceans or, better yet, how do you render oceans from above?	use houdini the hexagon will say

no. As soon as you go above 1080p it skews a lot towards the GPU, the higher the resolution, the more the load on the gpu and less on CPU. EDIT: you should have no problem with a 1070 at that aspect ratio as long as you don't aim for ultra I guess.	So my 1070 could easily handle 3440x1440p 21:9 or should I stick more to 16:9 1440p? Thanks for the fast reply!

Question about the TDEE spreadsheet: Should I be subtracting the calories I burn through exercise or not? I feel like I shouldn't but I then also feel like if I don't, I'm not being honest with the sheet. I don't log everything, mostly just the high calorie burning things like extended cardio. I haven't seen this discussed anywhere so I thought I'd see what the smart ladies (and dudes!) here thought. 	put in your gross calories, not your net.
Ummm I’ll take one 	I could totally use one if /u/binary_burn can save a couple!
I don't see why card check is preferable to the secret ballot from the worker's perspective. It's obviously preferable from the union's perspective.	If unions exist and are capable of affecting change, that's pretty beneficial to the workers.  Like.. yeah keeping a school open *directly* benefits teachers more than parents, but those parents probably don't want to defund their kid's school either.

Did the car stop in the middle of the road? Or did it just not start again after you pulled over until you tapped the sensor with the card again? 	I gave my phone to my friend and was able to drive around the block no problem. Even put the car in park and back into drive. I didn't try getting out of the car though, that would have probably locked it.
Hi there. From my experience the living together for 2 years requires a lot of proof. If you don't meet the requirements for it you won't get it. It's 6 or 8 letters addressed to you at the same address spanning 2 years? Also this is a very expensive route to go down. See my post on the other subreddit ukimmigration	Thanks for this. I’ve checked out your post, and you’re right - it’s a tough one. 
Your macros must input something like “Q, M1” then set walls to Q. Add a small delay between Q and M1 as well—like 2 ms. I would suggest AutoHotKey scripts, but I’m sure they ban accounts that have AHK running in the background. We’d need a statement from Epic before using AHK.	Interesting. I'm going to try this tonight! Will let you know if it works. Thanks 
I got to play a number of times with Sonny Simmons, a brilliant alto player. What I observed was the audience thrilled at the chops, loving the dexterity but not connecting to the actual thread like one does from a straight\-ahead solo. Predictability vs. novelty/innovation. To engage a non\-musician listener, there needs to be a thread they can relate to. A player may follow the train of phrases, but even then, prediction level is low, so you tune out after a few minutes. Dixieland \- high prediction, low innovation Avant\-garde low prediction, high innovation And in between is pretty much a timeline of great artists. But the MARKETABILITY and ACCESSIBILITY of free jazz will always be low because we no longer LISTEN to the music, it is mostly background.	Great points, thank you!
**"Players can no longer vote for themselves on the end of match awards screen."** Finally I no longer have to vote myself when I get a previous vote to show that I didn't vote for myself in the first place even though I ended up voting myself anyway.

The major point buried at the end is that Multnomah County has a higher voter turnout than previous years: &gt; In Multnomah County, with the state's highest voter registration, elections office spokesman Eric Sample said that voter turnout seems to be higher than in previous years. By end of day Monday, 95,276 Multnomah voters had returned their ballots, compared to 84,801 in 2014. So while Multnomah voters are highly-engaged, the rest of the state is sitting things out this go-around.	Washco is also highly engaged. Turnout is mostly suppressed outside of the Portland area.

I definitely fell into a post\-MCAT funk, and these three things really helped me regain my sanity and physical well\-being. Know that this is temporary and you will feel better soon 😊 👍	Thank you! Yeah I think I just need to put things back into perspective again. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one feeling this way after the MCAT :)
I could listen to you all day!	Aweee
Literally the worst CUV on the market the years it was offered. 	Especially since it wasn’t a CUV, but a RWD/4WD SUV (albeit unibody). Worst CUV probably goes to the Jeep Compass/Patriot.
&gt;That's exactly what they did to their previous competitors in other areas. which are?	Exactly!
Did anybody else read this in the article:   Trumps first stop on his first full day in office was to the CIA headquarters in Langley, VA. Literally. The first thing he does is march into the DeepStates HQ and tells them "this is how it is now."	And he said something about taking columns down
Looking for an all mountain board which should be better at freeride than freestyle. It should also be a bit playful and quite nimble as I want to take it inbetween trees etc. And id like to be able to take it easy and be lazy at times :) What do people recommend? Id like either RCR or CRC boards :)	Your best bet is to demo a few that you like. My favorite board right now that I take out whenever I'm just riding without a plan is my Rome Gangplank its a 15/16 but I love that thing
&gt; Wow, that's stone cold there, Kylo. Heh. I really like how your Kylo Ren has so much more focus than the movie version; it's a really intriguing take, and I would have loved to see how your version had played out once BB-8 figured out what's really going on. That is one fierce little droid, after all. ;)	Tweaking characters is an author's prerogative... ;-)
So you didn't get a chicken then	No chicken this game. :(
Maybe we’ll get a HL3 VR release one day! *crosses fingers* But seriously, even a TF2 VR version would be amazing! 	Tf2 is already playable in vr! It is hard to play though
[Err, you still can for reloads.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBSjdG7WG5I) It's a little trickier I admit but still there. 	how does this work? I used to do exactly that before the beta update, it doesn't seem to work anymore.
I just downloaded the source and started to polish some UI stuff and optimize performance in some parts.  Hope you don't mind random PR's :p.  I've been doing winforms dev full-time for 6 years now and need some more WPF exp, hardly touched it.  I was going to make my own program like this about a year ago but I don't have the free time to head a project myself.	Hi, regarding the UI I'll be rewriting a lot of stuff for [4.5](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/projects/8), but if you plan to do just small changes then feel free to commit PRs. For bigger stuff I would recommend getting in touch via Discord first so we can coordinate.
I'm working full time over the summer and am trying to find things to do with my days off in addition to the gym. Other than fishing and gardening, what fun things do you guys like to do outside? Currently the majority of my time is spent inside playing video games on my days off but the weather is too nice to ignore and I feel like I need to do something productive.	Go rock climbing for forearm gains
Don't buy it OR a Macbook unless your hobby is wasting money on useless garbage.	true
Finding products that work is such an incredible experience. I adore the biossance oil. It feels so luxurious and works so well. However.  you’re ever looking to pare down the price point, I’ve found that mixing TO’s rosehip and squalane oils produce pretty much the same result, and found a great vitamin C treatment to use separately. 	Ooh thanks for the tip! A broke girl living in NYC has gotta save lol. 
Girls, in a nutshell. Reminds me of the "I'm here if you need to talk" skit on Rick and Morty.	Love Rick and Morty! Just starting to get into it!
“Sometimes guys just pop up”	Hahaha I could see this happening 
Dusty’s feathers. I’m still recovering from that one. 	Same. I still can't process it.
I need help identifying the match this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0BAOtEKlho) is from as well.	i’ll be about 20-18 minutes 
He looked back at the owner like "if it wasnt for you"	????
As long as I'm allowed to have more.	Maybe ;) 
To be fair, they cancelled the show so why would they promote it? That said they have hardly ever promoted it and are to blame for that.	&gt;y would they promote it Because it's still currently on the air
How did Diaz leave the car w/o making a sound?!	Ducked down onto the floor
Wow! Yes! Thank you. Must have been a lovely day to walk around barefoot in the grass!	It was great!
So umm with the ending is Vanessa alive? 	Why didn't he save the other three?
Wow, as melon scratchers go, that's a honey doodle.	Could you impersonate Chief Wiggum for me? 
I pace nonstop when I'm on the phone	I do this too
This one pops really nicely 	Agreed, especially the wires and you can see the depth of length of the carriage. Heck, the reflections off of the windows are cool.
Is that an havanese?	She is a bijon shih tzu mix! They do look alike though. 
First guess...your P2P (red cable) network isn't getting power.  Try connecting it via ~~glass cables~~ Quartz Fibers (that only transfer power, not data) to a powered network section. edit: Notice in this screenshot(https://i.imgur.com/TUPdqhC.png), it says "Stored Power: 0 RF" at the top and "Energy Usage: 0 RF/t" at the bottom?  afaik, it shouldn't be 0 unless it's not getting [enough] power. 2nd edit: fix the glass cable/quartz fiber mixup.	A second problem I noticed...there's 9 devices (P2Ps) that use channels in the above screenshot on the red cabled network.  Networks without a controller max out at 8 channels.
Oh wow, those are some huge cookies! They're about the width of Sayori's shoulders. 	Hope she doesn’t eat them all, she could get a stomachache 
It's tripping me out that they're wearing similar colors too	i'm high and this is weird
Francis 	I hope it doesn’t happen but I can see it happen. Initially when he joined I thought he really only joined to get exposure for his standup career but don’t really feel that way anymore though it did help his standup career forsure
He wants to see your bf too? Lol tf	Still holding out hope that maybe the bf is 17 
Had Stafford and Johnson on my fantasy team in 2011, which was the first year I played fantasy football.  After that season, I knew it was a match made in heaven	Ditto, exact same story
Do I spy a Mirialan?	I believe you do..
a man wearing a mustache and a name tag / uniform.	The username is accurate enough 
Hopefully someone on here recognizes him so he doesn't have trouble getting in tomorrow!	Do you need ID to get in? Buying a Sunday ticket from someone, how would that work?
I recently subscribed to r/tiltshift and it's becoming increasingly difficult to know which sub I'm clicking into. 	I remember a post on there a few days ago, [this](https://i.imgur.com/RrGl1YT.jpg), and thinking this is actually what games like CS should be looking like soon enough.
Where is Astolfo?	Astolfo's would be "*succ succ*"
is 3 anki and 3 mask change a must for the future of heros? I have seen that not only are there a bunch of other masked heros, but there are also other mask change spell cards 	Mask Change is the only good one, that will be necessary at 3. Anki can get by at 2 in the future, but 3 of that is best as well.
He's gonna drone out the elevator .... Which he already is in. 😂😂	Don’t let them know that 🌚😂
An i3 8100 would be plenty, but I recommend grabbing a discrete GPU (i.e.: GTX 1050 Ti).	thanks so much! &amp; one last question.. Build a PC myself? or Buy a pre-built one? ^^
You know something is wrong then Edward is top-fragging	Edward is always good on inferno, the problem was s1mple electronic and flamie not showing up until the second half 
You’re the only other person I’ve seen get those masks! 	We will have to reconvene after use and compare notes!!
Does All for One cry? That's the only reliable factor.	Izuku got that trait from his mom
Score 99!	I love the score 99 reference. I was upset the "Rock Me Amadeus" chant did not happen but my feelings are not hurt too badly. 
Ok. Ok. Ok. (Sigh) Y’all scared me and I have a doctor appt in the morning. Thanks, haha	Please don't scratch at it and then touch things. If it's active it can spread. There will be others in the waiting room I'm sure, so be mindful. They may be extra vulnerable to infections. 
Quick question...has this ever happened in history before? And i don't mean cigarettes replacing currency types but coins and notes replacing coins and notes types.	It's happened quite a lot actually.  A country's currency experiences hyperinflation and people switch to more stable foreign currencies or bartering hard assets. Also, what happened here could also be construed as a bubble in worthless assets.  And that's happened a lot too, unfortunately.
My friend made this site. Might help. http://karaokelistings.com/	Maybe this website should be on the sidebar because of how good of a source it is
i mean it got posted here so way more than 36 ppl seen it to be able to report her	No the stream ended with 36 people in it. I posted a clip way after it was done
Have you heard of the Avett Brothers? 	I have not. Are they any good?
There was a rumor going around before the last Direct that a Link’s Awakening remake was going to be announced for 3DS but nothing ever came of it. I’m still holding out hope.	Would LA benfit from a remake considering it's on the eShop? It's still a beautiful game as is.
I wonder, if you do this with think enough pieces, can you get high res smaller duplicates?	They'll always be at most a quarter the resolution of the previous image.
Can you please make me a [Nivin](https://imgur.com/a/BFDNjvY)? Thank you!	Handsome
What server are you trying to play in?	NA. I just had a decent stretch of finding games pretty quick, but now I'm back to long queues no matter how many times I refresh or restart the game. This makes me think It wasn't time of day related like I initially thought.
Hmm, why not reduce the work hours so that 'boredom' isn't a problem.  Move away from hours-based compensation and move towards task-based.  This 40 hour workweek 'standard' needs to change.  Productivity gains to the worker, for once.  Jeez	You're assuming there's someone somewhere handing out tasks. That's not really how a skilled salaried job works.
10 man ½ ppr Who would you rather have straight up - R.Cobb or R.Woods?	Woods
I would tell you to point out that the electricity costs of running their computer+screen are higher than the vBucks they're earning, but their parents pay their electricity bills...	Their parents don't give them money for vbucks, so these players exchange their parents money in the form of the electricity bill to get less money in the form of vbucks.
S	E
If you have coconut oil handy give that a try. Sometimes I use it to take my eyeliner off and after I wash my face most of the oil is gone along with the makeup.	Thank you both! Do you use the oil that is liquid at room temp of just warm it up in your hands first?
The only problem with this is that if they track your computer use, they may terminate you for misuse of company assets. Maybe bring your own laptop or tablet from home.	Kindle.
I'm quite mean to my KDF exchange program officers, I told them this was regulation Starfleet Uniform. https://i.imgur.com/Q3YRiaI.jpg	The poor gorn. 
The amount of progress that has been completed on Nano over the past 6 months is insane, especially compared to most projects in the space.  What's equally insane is that the price has not reflected this, at all.	Blame Bitgrail for that..
This gap is going to be massive. 10 /ES handles and growing.	How do you see it, if I may ask?
Excuse my ignorance but what does the 9v/18v switch do effect"wise"?	I believe the higher voltage allows for more headroom, giving it a fuller tone. I may be incorrect but this is what it seems to do. 
Most people start working on OAHS with two\-hand flags and block walks/stacks.	thanks, i see how impt the blocks are and flags too.
The swooping sound of a coat rack is gnarly.	Nails on a chalkboard
I WANT THEM	ME TOO. We need to go find one.
I'd love to see Sarah as the villain!	Yes!! Just once man. I thought she was going o be in the cult but alas. 
I don’t understand why washers / dryers don’t have a guide like this on them.	Because that would be convenient.
how are people making these bases?	In the base designer.
People talk about her a lot because as some others pointed out she’s quite polarising as a character. \[Anime Spoilers\]&gt;!\(#s "I just love her story because it’s heartbreaking, but she also so much to atone for and I hope she gets the chance to. She had conflicting loyalties before, so it would be interesting to see where she sides when she wakes up, and she will"\)!&lt;	Tag spoilers please! This thread isn't even tagged for Anime Spoilers.
Is that an ML300L? They're a decent light.	Indeed it is. 
&gt;  The idea that women were discriminated against across the course of history is appalling. &gt; ...The idea that women were an oppressed minority under those conditions is insane. &gt; ...There was no equality for women before the birth control pill. It’s completely insane to assume that anything like that could’ve possibly occurred. LOL, the Guru contradicts himself more than once within the same paragraph as usual. How this doofus became so popular is beyond me.	Female hunter gatherers were pretty much equal to men. No pill needed, they just used infanticide, which there was no stigma against. And this dude fancies himself as an anthropologist.
I love dogs, but I can't tell you how many times poeple get upset at me for standing between their dog and my kids, not just cause they might bite,but because they are friendly and jump up on my kids knocking them to the ground. Not to say I haven't run into well trained dogs, just seems the dogs with no manners outweigh the well trained ones. 	Some people are allergic to dogs or have a dog that *isn't* friendly but leashed, even if your dog is friendly the other party may not react well.

Do you know what kind of lumber it is? it's gorgeous 	The two outsides and the center is oak, the other 4 boards I'm unsure. I've had a few people say it might be maple of some sort.
Better than most bottled waters and perfectly safe to drink.	Not Copenhagen though. It tastes fine, but it's got a ridiculous amount of limescale in it.
remarkable performance	He needs to loosen up, make it natural, or else no Groot 2022 role for him.
I really dig this UI. I love that suttle shine/blur that comes off it, almost makes it look futuristic... 	"subtle" FYI 
i would pass on 146 with those 2 classes. with shapiro, the programming assignments are every week and can be hard	Thanks for the input! I think I'll pass it then. Would you know of any "easy" CS electives (I know they're all upperdivs and not easy at all, but relatively)?
I was just in middle of a call, and it was dropped, and now my phone is showing "No Service" :(	Lol same. I kept talking for a while before I noticed.
You need a financial plan that you both can work with. And if you borrow money from her you should expect her to ask for it back.	I agree with the financial plan, work has been up and down the past few years and I should be better at saving.
Nice. 	Nice.
You're vastly underestimating my abilities of self delusion.	George Costanza?
Rega in backround? 	Yup, the P1
Orlandeau because he is a boring unit 	i used to be this since i already had OK, but now with eFryevia he's back in the limelight
Posting in legendary thread 	Why do they excrete in boutique?
Don't forget that the company value might go down if people really react for the Tencent stuff which allows Chris to buy back those 80% for 10% of the value and rebuild GGG while keeping a profit of 45 chaos	Well he does have a degree in economics or finance or something.
The mongoose arms break pretty easily.  They are wide horizontally but thin vertically.  Should be the other way around!	Ok thanks! Im looking into some other ones :)
I'm not a kid, and i dont have kids (23m) but id be down to play! im new to the game too so i feel like i would benefit just as much!	If I’m short a person I’ll let you know :)
Censorship	True censorship in FEH would mean half the girls being removed.
Hey buddy, I’m away from Bath those dates but if you get yourself down to the Bath brew house they will have an array of ales and will show the football, plus you’ll be able to make friends in there no trouble. 	Thanks for the tip, bud. Will definitely check it out.
wow, what an awesome picture	Thank you! I'm just getting into photography and I was playing with my camera setting when I took this photo. 
npm install —save-dev eslint	It worked, thanks!
My top tip would be : don't call everything index.js unless it is simply that, an index file. Not that anybody has done that here. It irks me no end having my editor open and seeing row upon row of index.js, searching for stuff becomes a nightmare too. Also, I often suffix what the file does on the end. Eg thing.component.js, thing.styles.js, thing.container.js, you can then export stuff from an index file but the 'real' code is contained in the file that is named after what it does. Also means when you import stuff you can get an idea of what it does from the import string. Anyway, that's my two cents.	I've made this mistake once and agree. Makes it a real pain if you like to use cmd+p in VScode or similiar editors to look up a file (i.e. a component) if they are all "index.js".
WHEEL WHEEL WHEEL	yes, it’s so calming and different than his other stuff
We are ALL mountains on this blessed day.	Speak for yourself
I'm moving to NW Arkansas in a few months. Beautiful place.	It is getting cucky really quickly up there though. The big corps keep importing soy and it is turning that corner of our map blue. 
I wouldn't be able to lift if I saw you in the gym.	I doesn't give you that extra surge of blood you need?
Christopher’s intervention the whole thing 	Easily one of the funniest things ever. Also these answers remind me just how dark the humor is in this show 
I started using a Diva Cup this week and oh. my. goodness. it is life changing. I’m kicking myself for not trying this sooner.	yeeesssss
No.	No what? I thought they were pretty cool.
Why did he put this on you and not just do it himself? 	Because he's an old dude who doesn't know how to use computers.

That's kinda weird that it's so close	Auraxis must be flat like the earth. 
Question for season plan holders: does Red Carpet Rewards for a half season plan actually add up to anything? My account rep changed 4x so I never really got more info. After the Wizards/Caps burned me by getting rid of Monumental Rewards \(or whatever it was called\) before last season without notice before I could cash in my points for a bobblehead I haven't really bothered with any other rewards system. So far I've only seen auctions for RCR that I have no hope of winning. Is there anything else to it?	If you look on the rewards website there is a separate "Marketplace" section with stuff like hats and items from the giveaways
My husband was like "Okay, I thought something horrible happened." He had to coax me out of the closet because I was in there crying my eyes out. That kiddo is now four. The second one, he told me I was pregnant because I stopped eating my favorite food and didn't really notice. Plus I kept telling him his chocolate coffee smelled disgusting. He was extremely excited to be right. 	sounds like a great guy
Added!	Added!
Dm me 	May I?
Gotta do it. Please don't impale me--.	*readies pitchfork*
tbh no coach was ever going to be able to replace Sarri \(obviously\) but Ancelotti has TONS of experience and can attract big names to the club. As long as he puts in the effort to prove he's still got it I think we can continue to be competitive in the league, and maybe Champions League too.	The only one can can replace him is Guardiola which is sad but well never be able to see him in Napoli, or if by any chance ADL hires someone and he   becomes Sarri 2.0
Are those the OEM roof rack rails?	Nah these are the aeroblade edge's from Thule. The OEMs are cheaper but they are silver and I wanted to keep the white/black combo going. The OEMs also stick out over the mount feet, I think these look a little cleaner being flush.
They'll probably end up making them 5 lug. I just don't see Tesla putting out center locks.	Either that or they make a adapter to convert from 5 lug to center lug.
Its not really that broken. The benefit you get from having insta super regen is offset by the fact that tether isn't that uber a super.	Well it suppressed every enemy it catches and it gives a damage boost against them, plus nearly endless orb generation. Compared to 90% of the other exotic armor pieces it could be considered broken.
How are people getting their 100 super kills? Using tractor cannon for the power kills has been working extremely well so far. 	That's why it's a swordfest.....
Lots of potential. Reminds me a little of Layla from SBX, or even Sa-Roc, rhyme-scheme-wise.	Thank you very much for taking time to give me feedback. Have heard of Layla &amp; will look up Sa\-Roc :\) Cheers heaps mate
This hurts to look at.	"Recommended for windows XP" Nah I put a quarto fx 1500 in it and win 7 runs fine. 
Curry with the harden-esque head snap	without the backlash 
Why do petrol stations state “unleaded” if we don’t use leaded anyway? It’s like saying “meat burger” instead of burger.	My only guess is that they do it to differentiate between the gasoline pumps that dispense higher octane fuel or diesel.
Are you on beta 1.3.11 or higher?  This was [listed as fixed](https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/stardew-valley-multiplayer-beta-known-issues-fixes.142850/), and you should submit a bug report if it's still happening.	Wait, that was fixed? I gotta update and play the game again!
Netgear Prosafe switches are fanless. I'm 99% sure they make a 48port. Just make sure you get the full L3 version, because they make the L2 1/2 switches that aren't VLAN capable and missing a bunch of functionality.	Nevermind, it looks like the 48port variants DO have fans. I am unsure of the volume, as i only use the &lt;/= 24port versions.
Kirby...	Kirby would've been a great Blockbuster game, if that was still around.  Not worth owning for $60 because you can finish everything in a weekend.
He gave it a very good go. His answers generally made me very exciting for the upcoming season. I'm not sure when I was this excited for the next season. Some of these players are going to change drastically, and for the good I hope. I believe the hard working players are going to shine even more so now.	As much as they frustrate me, I would obviously love it if he changed players like Mustafi, Iwobi, Xhaka etc
The Professor Layton series. I spent so much time playing those games, but I've never met an irl fan.	So underrated, I swear, all the storylines and main characters were really interesting from what I can remember
I heard a while ago that Dunkin was moving into that corner spot, but I dunno if that's still happening.  If you want inexpensive frozen yogurt, Green Apple on Crescent is good. Limited flavor selection, but they're nice and it's cheap.	Thanks for the suggestions. If this is the case, I'd love to confirm it so that at least i have some closure.
This is some great art, do u do any other characters?	yes i do actually, naruto characters are my favorite to draw :)
I really like this idea, I wonder if it would be something that we could do on a monthly/quarterly basis to see what ideas people have, and so Tesla has a place where people share what people want (with upvotes) and implement as they see fit. Would love if Tesla themselves could reach out if we could help in some way.	Like this idea.  If it becomes a thing, a few rules should be: 1) no duplicates, 2) only 1 idea per post (so the good ideas get upvoted, not the ones that have multiple ideas.). 
Do you know of any examples of real world scenarios where feminists have to actually confront criticism? It only seems to happen online.	Yes, but only in environments where there are some rules of engagement such as committee and board rooms. 
I love this classic.  Here's another engineering classic for you: In theory, theory and practice are the same thing.  In practice, they're not.	That's pretty humorous
He should be in the RV trip	Pewdiepie is too good for scuffed RV trips 
That's great. I wish I could do amazing things with yoga	You can! 
I just gave them flour regularly, their hearts went up fast.	This. Flour is cheap, can be bought all in one go on a trip to their house. Great advice that someone else also offered me.
I might be able to help with this! Are you looking for EM? 	Not necessary :) I can add them on later 
Roast potatoes. 	That is going to be a no from me Dawg.
Music stands and shopping carts always seem to be in disrepair 	Now you know why. 
I am kinda new to this sub and didn't see the exact info in the sidebar, but didn't want to start my own post, so hopefully this is a good place to ask! Do you put your starting weight as your heaviest point, even if it was 7 years ago? I'm also struggling to come up with a goal weight. I have a larger frame, so I'm not sure what's realistic. Honestly, I never thought I could even get into the 130s, so I'm ecstatic, but feel like I could still lose more now that I'm here. How did you all choose yours?	I used my weight from the day that I started keto. For my goal weight, I chose the middle of the 'healthy range' for my height and I'll see how I feel once I get into the healthy range bracket and adjust from there. 
Honestly, there's not much to play on the switch right now that isn't available in a superior form on another platform, and this is not a good use case for a portable system.	BOTW is easily 50+ hours (plus the DLC) Odyssey is the same case There’s things to play you just need to look into the shop like Celeste and mega man that just came out. 
I'm digging the leather case. 	Thanks, they're hand made in Europe. It was well worth the wait for it to make it here in the states.
Vulcanpost should know better. $2 million in **revenue** isn’t the same as **profit**.	They do know better... just counting on readers not
I wouldn't be worried about the no2, but I would be worried about the pills they give you after. As far as "sobriety" medically prescribed and necessitated medicine should not count against your sobriety. If you use as prescribed. Just don't deviate from how they are supposed to be used, and ideally be honest with someone about your addictive past so they can help hope you accountable.	I’ll be fine with the pills, I come from a community plagued by the opioid crisis, I don’t plan on using much of the pills they give me. 
Join the "Adopt a Villager" event. You can find in the subreddit sidebar in the "Join the Community." section.	Sorry if this is a dumb question, but where is this 'join the community' section you speak of? I can't find it.
I mean no offense but what did you think was going to happen?	Kumbaya?
Also curious to this. Like what are the requirements to get the armor?	You just level up like carbide. Level 80 is max armour
why put it in the freezer instead of just letting it cool normally. putting something that just came out of the oven in a freezer sound like a good way to spoil everything else in there 	Warm banana cake with melty icing is the best. 
EUREKAS OUTFIT WAS TERRIBLE. I’m mad she wasn’t in the bottom	I don't think it was bad but it's definitely something we've seen her do a few times before 
I know this is anticonsumption, but those are some of the best value coupons you can find if you really need to get something. For example, you can get 10% off major appliances like a refrigerator or something. Of course, 10% off something you don’t need at all is still a waste.	Yes, but you can opt-in for a lot of those coupons digitally when you change your address through USPS, online (Lowe’s, Wayfair, Overstock).  It’s redundant of them to also send them in the mail.  Though, the best option is still to buy used, if possible, even on appliances.
I don't think anyone played it, it's not available for purchase on PC unless you use windows store which would be stupid. I hope it failed miserably.	I'm literally playing it right now. It's not a masterpiece buts it's also not a bad game. I'm having a lot of fun just exploring and fighting hordes.
I really think Inoue is going to make this look ridiculously easy. Bodyshot KO in Round 5.	Even easier than you thought. 
I mean it's been my experience having the likes/dislikes conversation doesn't do much because people are afraid to reveal their true kinks. 	Most, yes. Some aren't. 
Nice team. Getter a better GK (even a GB like Fahrmann would be great) and a better Right Winger (Bale/Robben/Salah)	Will willian or CALLEJON do?
100 baseline, 200 ideal. Just pick a deadline and divide the number of days by the total cards number	The deadline is a good point

I swapped out the keyboard and wlit wokred just fine, but for some reason the laptops will only turn on when the keyboard is out of the computer and when I out it in while on, nothing happens, but turning it off, and pressing the power does nothing. Only boots when keyboard is in?	Hmm, must be a bad cable in the keyboard, and something is being shorted. 
You should really ask your dad, not us lol	He has no clue....
D - No preference.  At these ranges, the slight changes aren't likely to make a difference for most people.	That means 1. 100kWh, if only because that saves costs for Tesla.
I missed Scathach hard, including not getting a 2030 from her banner which blew. Yesterday though, I went and looked for Li Shuwen because I realized I've used him maybe once? None of my friends have him and couldn't find him in 20 refreshes.	I have one friend who has him somewhere, however because Rashomon is up, erryone going full Shishou/Karna now.
Glad you all turned out okay!	I'm glad it worked out for the best, thank you.

Seems like a pretty effective method of stopping the spread of germs though. Didn't the Mythbusters do something like that and find that sneezing into the elbow is the most effective way of stopping germs? 	I do that but then I still wash my hands afterwards just in case someone heard me but didn't see that I vampire sneeze.
I got one that attaches to the window. I have to use these for work at construction sites. This setup works pretty well and is easily detachable for storage.  [window mount whip flag](http://www.safetywhips.com/Light_Duty_Whips_Mounts.html) 	Thank you!!

Literally every single concert in the world (including BH) has merch. It's unheard of for artists to not have merch at shows	I figured this concert will be my first real concert that’s why I asked 
You gotta have some pretty bad situational awareness to not gauge the other customers when you’re robbing a store. Just a quick look around and he would’ve realized “thats a pretty big dude with a camouflage hat and his shirt tucked in to his jeans. He will probably be a threat”	Think how stupid someone has to be to rob a convenience store nowadays. I don't think situational awareness would be one of his strong suits.

That's amazing. Put it into a scene for us! xD I think the motion blur is a bit too strong	Thank you! I think it's a bit too strong too looking back at it, just kinda slapped it together tonight so I'll be tweaking a lot when I re-render things.

Orange laces look sick, don’t know if i would rather put the blue laces on the other or some green laces	I put orange in the left and green in the right from the Chicago’s. The green laces make the unc’s look a million times better.

so real "sjws" aren't extreme enough to laugh at, and make you uncomfortable to confront their points, so you literally make up fake ones to mock instead?	Basically /r/TumblrInAction.  It's how they radicalize teens.  It's all "just jokes" until you've indoctrinated them.
I feel like this is a direct result of me putting a Beto sign in my front lawn last week. I started supporting him after [Beto was on Bill Maher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFn04RRqazc).	dont feel this way, i just wanted someone different then ted cruz

GSW VS CAVS .....not looking good for the cavs right now but still	Both teams are playing brick. Cavs only down by 4. Experience will kick in soon in which the Cavs can they relax and dominate.

I liked The Truth, Pyramids and Mort the most. I also enjoyed Going Postal although many aren't keen. The shades make me think of a rough version of the shambles in York. Anything with the Patrician is usually good. Also... 'in-sewer-ants'. 	Do you also study reflected-sounds-of-underground-spirits?
When I was around 10, I had a baby sitter who was pretty mean. One day I climbed up on the roof  and started yelling "help me" down the chimney. She heard the screaming and went to the fireplace and tried to look up.  I then dropped water balloons down the chimney. You wouldn't believe the mess, her face and hair was covered with wet soot. I definitely got the belt when my parents arrived home but... I would have to say it was worth it at the time. She never came back, and life went on.	Calvin, is that you?
Yes it does.	People are counting out the rockets waaaay too soon. Its a one game to win it all and they are home. Role players are known to have stupid good games at home, and game 7 is a lottery, anyone can win. Lets go rockets
I don't get it. Anyone care to enlighten me?	Dude is always ded
As I recently asked and found out, GWD2 armor is only good if you don’t augment it. If you do it’s the same drain rate as Nex armors. So most people opt for Nex, I like GWD2 cause it’s the poor mans version :D	\^\^ If you don't have invention unlocked, GW2 armor is way more economic than Nex armor, but if you have invention unlocked then I'd upgrade to Virtus, Torva and Elite Robin Hood armor respectively for mage, melee and ranged. 
That it? 	Everyone finished truck and left lol 
Saxamaphone.	Honk-a-ma-flute
If you're looking for a game similar to Machi Koro, the new game Space Base is probably just what you're looking for, though it only plays up to 5. 	Excellent - thank you for the recommendation!!
Funny that the announcer is describing a great defensive play with the verb "slash"	Technically, under the rules, I think that should be a penalty. I don't think it should be though.
So is the top where the water comes from or the bottom?	seawater pressure is on the bottom, firehose or a wye gate would be on the top. 
What did you do for Overkill?	Bought him. He's a TFCC figure.
I just justified my box the other day by pulling out an old USB printer cable I needed. (Because printers still don't come with them.)	Best buy has to make money on something. Cables are pure profit. 
You liked your own comment OMEGALUL	He didn't, i liked it :)
The cow is looking at him like "Go play with Michael."	Where...are your fingers?
I’m seriously concerned that when Cespedes comes back they’re either gonna bench Nimmo/Conforto or drop Gonzalez who has been playing well to start Bruce at first. Bruce has been absolutely terrible and I bet they’re gonna prioritize him due to the money. The Bruce contract is gonna be uglyyy for the Mets.	I hope they DL him and see if his foot gets better

Trem effects bending a bit. Having a floating trem that's easily movable, it will give in when you're doing bends. Other than that, it might just be your own feel.	Interesting thats another factor i didnt think of
You know what the worst part is? I can feel your heartbeating.	Still wondering why steve was still holding on after he realized it. The two of them definitely need to discuss their feelings for one another. 
My advice to the stock market is that if you ever are considering if you should sell, and you don't have a belief that things will turn around, then sell for a loss and move on. 	yeah, but what if the stock price is going up, and you can sell for a profit? 
I'm thinking yes, why are you waiting.   	🤷‍♀️

Just remember, Ice said you shouldn't mix friendships and Business, which is why he doesn't put jacob on stream. SSJ is a friend to ice and he manager. His view of SSJ is blinded by this. SSJ actions is only going to make it harder for him to get other personalities on stream because they will be afraid of SSJ. 	How many managers in this scene are paying for RV deposits and driving their client around the US. 
Is this supposed to be funny and meta for anyone who has seen The Office (US) 	Yeah I was just having a laugh. It'll probably get removed when a mod sees it anyway 😒
Invest some money in a sub mmorpg. Play FFXIV. It's 300 hours just playing the story casually. It's super polished and easy to get into. Buy a complete edition and tell your friends you'll see them in september.	Plus it's free till level 35 anyways, so you don't have much to lose.

Sounds silly, but Ronaldinho? He (understandably) chose the life of luxury rather than maintaining his physical peak and staying at Barca.	Not only that, he never put in effort for the NT after he had won everything, which he did quite early due to the amazing players around him. He was very average for the NT.
Please link a source I believe this thread could be reclassified as "rumor"	&gt; I believe this thread could be reclassified as "rumor" You're being pretty generous there. 
Gosh, part of the reason I wanted to complete that quest was just to stop all the guards from saying that. 	Recruiting campaign successful.

Really disappointing to not see a goal from that PP	I disagree!

Yeah well when you stop having children you cause labor shortages and need to bring foreign labor.	hello Europe
What about all the people that play single or duo no fill in teams of 20? You could have anywhere up to 20 different squads in one team of 20	Very true, i would argue that if someone chooses to go no fill then they don't want to communicate so they wouldn't be included in the cross squad comms
DICE needs to step up and release more purchasable skins (and emotes, poses). It's getting pretty ridiculous. We are in a position where the community is more reliably providing skins than DICE themselves.. I can't figure out why they're not dropping a few dozen retextures to erode our credits... Amateurs are churning these out in a matter of hours or a couple of days. Should we have to BEG them to try to make money? It's messed up.	They abandoned the game. Simple as that, now everyone should move on.
No.	Why not.

I would have saved all 4 for a true all stars season, but I’m not complaining because I enjoyed them and appreciate them as characters and players!	But the pool for all stars is so deep! Going all the way back to 9! These are 4 solid choices and no winners to take away from a winner or all star season! 
They often have a book of regular stuff they do or you can take a photo and ask for something 'similar' (some of them get fussy about copying another artists work)	Omg thank you! So do I just ask to see it when I first go in? 
As a personal finance nerd, I can't help but wonder if Sarah has 3 \- 6 months of emergency savings built up. Is she saving for retirement? Investing? It's all I can think about when she trots out yet another pair of too tight Loft shorts. 	I seriously doubt it. I don’t think she would have sold off a bunch of stuff when she got laid off if they had a substantial amount of money saved. I think her severance paid off the car. 
FG Knot. Tricky to master but it casts through guides like butter. [Here is an excellent video on how to do it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDip4_e4c0U) 	Doh.

What a heaven. I’ll be sure to try and find it when I go there next week. Do you know if they are selling P3D/P5D there?	Yup, they selling merch for the dance game as well as the animation.

What I can’t stand is when men refuse to drink from a straw and either A) bend it over the side of the glass B) toss it on the floor C) toss it on my bar Because it’s “not manly” to have a straw or stirrer You’re making a mess and wasting straws. Just say you don’t want one. 	You have to ask for a straw at like half of the bars in my city now.
In an interview with Jamie Hewlett he was asked the question; how will Gorillaz look like in 10 years? His answer was they'll be exactly the same because they're cartoon characters. 	Well, exept for noodle I suppose. She's the only one who made significant changes during the phases. From being 10 to like 26. But I doubt she'll change much from now on.
Do we want old man Patterson here with his finger on the button?!?	Old? I'm only four years older than you.

I don't understand why he didn't just say this when it happened. People roasted him at the time. Seems odd	Meh. It's not like he trashed the Pats on his way out. He just didnt want to play anymore. I dont see how it's his responsibility to let everyone know why.

Hi! Thanks for doing this. I've been following you since Mega's release and I really love your productions, especially Reformation pt2, which is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. My question and probably many of other as well is: when reformation pt 3 is coming out? xD Another question: are you planning on doing a remix album of the reformations songs? Love you guys! Keep up the awesome work.	Hey! So glad you found our music and enjoy our latest album! New music is on work all the time! But for now, we are celebrating this release :) There will be some remixes released later this year for sure!
Occasionally  when testing missions with a lot of restarting via Shift + R external camera stops responding to all mouse commands.  Scroll wheel stops zooming, mouse movement stops moving camera.  Only recourse is to restart the game.	I have the same problem with others modules too, the game open the registration windows and ask me for the serial number of Nevada. Try to change the Windows focus and see if you have this other Windows open, if so, you just need to closed it 
So if we sweep how many games back would we be? 	I suppose it depends on how AZ does.

Asking my name, telling me specifically not to tuck your sheets in, then turning to your friend who's on the phone and asking if he wants his sheets tucked in, he then changes his mind a few times and finally gets mad at me for throwing away a napkin he wrote some jokes on. Then at the end of the stay, forgetting to leave a tip!	This is the wisdom I was looking for. 
Wait how do users hide their flair? Do they just not receive one or something?	Right below "X users fighting for glory", there is a checkbox and text beside it that says "Show my flair on this subreddit." If you were to uncheck the checkbox then you would no longer see your flair displayed beside your name.

Try keeping your favorite non-alcoholic drinks around. Colas, lemonade, iced teas, etc are good options. Even stuff to make milkshakes. Now isn’t the time to worry about sugar. If your craving is between something sugary and alcohol, go for the sugar. Also: I find  I want to drink more when I’m hungry or bored. Just keep that in mind.	Pounding the lime LaCroix as we speak

&gt; Charity work is great but I fear that charities are just picking up what the government wilfully drops as they abrogate their social responsibility. The increase in the charity sector validates Tory policy and masks its effects. A fantastic excuse to assuage your conscious.	&gt;I don't do charity work because then other people wouldn't feel bad and do it instead.

My grandfather refused to donate anything to the Red Cross. Because of this.  In WWII he said the Red Cross would hand a GI a donut and coffee and then charge them for it.  The Salvation Army gave the GIs donuts and coffee for free.	My Uncle the was the same for the same reason.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1624848/star-wars-event-optional-or-mandatory Nothing definitive, but posters there agree with your conclusion.

So ford found that only freshly made hosts were able to avoid degredation. He then made Bernard from scratch, and now he just piggybacks on Bernard and never degrades? Also, I'm going to need a timeline update.	Likely he is degrading, and is the reason Bernard (Berfordnald?) is degrading in the present. Ford's killing himself again.
Transition PBJ maybe? that's what i'm building.	Yea i was taking a look at that.  LBS has the built one but 1599 a little steep for the build.

There's a "help I'm stuck" button in the menu if you ever get stuck on a ledge with no way out. This helps the devs identify design flaws in maps. Please use this, it really helps.	It also resets you to the beginning location, so you're no longer stuck.
Anyone know what triggers Lich to waste his turn by converting himself to water element? I was able to exploit this in lower floors but now I’m on floor 134 and can’t seem to trigger it at all.	Not sure what exactly, but it seems it's low hp.

I wonder if there are hundreds or thousands of people ahead of me.	since most of the GCs are tracked through alpha console you can find the amount of gc players in trackers. 
I don't know if this is the right place to put this but I finished the Greed Island arc. It was  my least favorite arc (apart from the zoldyck family one). Still really good though.

Umm..if you haven't finished hxh, especially chimaera ant arc,I'd advise you to stay away from the sub, you will get spoilers everywhere.

Add me for later I guess if you want to. I don't usually play comp, coz it's really stressful, and it's helluva lot more toxic than QP. I don't think I've played a couple of more games after the placement matches, so I don't know where exactly I fall, but, am a low silver after placement. Also, dunno how to coordinate and all, never done it Here's my id: Knight#13478	I just play comp like serious qp but yeah people tend to get really toxic, I just mute them. I usually tell about flankers and when I am gonna ult.

&gt;That was a pretty interesting comment by Woj. He also said the Bulls want to **accelerate the rebuild**. Don’t think they’ll be going after LeBron or Paul George, but they could extend an offer sheet to a **RFA like Clint Capela, Jabari Parker, Jusuf Nurkic or Marcus Smart.** uh oh 	Keep in mind that's just mark speculating
I'm not sure how the 25% increase in defence from Rigour works. For instance, is it only for melee defence or ranged defence as well?	It's a 25% increase in your defence level so that effects ranged, melee and to a smaller extent magic as well

Definitely consult an attorney. Property owners often owe for damages caused by actions they take that cause cave\-ins on a neighbor's land. But you want to take stock of that damage on your own terms \- and not just let them handle it entirely. Without your own documentation, they may be able to claim later that issues that arise are not their fault or are because of your parent's actions. It also sounds potentially still dangerous for the rest of your house...you want someone on your side professionally assessing whether there is further damage that may occur. 	I second this. Have the inspection check the house as well. There may have been damage to the foundations and you don't want time to pass and not be able to prove it later on.
I had the same problem, but I assumed it was just because I rooted my phone recently	Oh, mine was brand new :-( It's alright now though. Liking this new phone. Bought it after my Z Play got stolen :-(
Account Details &gt; Plan and Billing Info on the app should give you this info. 	It does not.  It says “Next Billing Date: August 5, 2018.” Below that is a 2 line blank space and then below that “2 Movies.” That’s it.

Just bad luck roll of the dice for Pitt. The Penn State series was extended to include 2018 and 19 in Deccember of 2012 when it looked like Penn State might be bad for a while, the UCF series was scheduled after a 6-7 season, and ND is auto-scheduled by the ACC, if I remember correctly. 	Ya, we've had brutal schedules the last few seasons. Things calm down next year for awhile I believe.

Nursing student here.. I feel like if the wrong bacteria get into here uterus it could lead to infection. The chances of this increasing if she's had children before, as the cervix never completely closes the same afterwards. Just a hunch, but sticking your tongue in it may not be the best thing for her. 	That was my thought as well
am still hoping for an OVA of this series.	Apparently, there’s gonna be some sort of IBO announcement very soon, so we may get something at least similar to that

At least he didnt seem to be a bad loser smiling after he lost	Yeah, he was dancing in stuff, but he was certainly keeping in mind that he'd lose on a 8 as he was. Maybe he did it for mind games, or maybe just for show. One thing for sure, it wasn't 100% genuine I WON celebration.
Yes. Adding to that, it would also help if people took pictures from their back cameras. My front camera makes me look FLAWLESS but the back camera shows the actual progress.	Yesss. Just realised like a month ago that my back camera takes so much sharper pictures. Wish I had thought of it sooner, now I can't really know for sure what my skin looked like when I first started my routine.
It's a lot easier to do when it's just text on the screen.  That's just how things are. Plus, if it were voice acted, that's a difficult line to walk.  It's hard to make a character sound stupid without being offensive to someone who actually has learning disability.  It would probably get annoying too.	If it wasn't voice acted, it would be just text on the screen, and would be great if they did it.  But they probably wont :(
I don't think we should be. I'm deeply steeped in revolutionary politics but I think UBI is actually a good path to building structures and institutions outside of "the system". One of the main problems with trying to get people to organize or join unions or, anything pretty much, is the lack of time/money. Right now, if anyone strikes, they risk not getting paid and not being able to feed their family. Also, if we are to build alternative structures, like our own people's healthcare or something in order to challenge the strength of the capitalist structures, we can't do that without money and resources. No, it won't free anyone from wage labor. But I think it will improve enough peoples' standings that they would actually be willing and able to engage in revolutionary organizing.	That's a really interesting point.
This is probably bilateral chimerism...Two faces, because it was once two kitties.	ED-WARD?
This is like a piece of art!	Thank you, I had fun making it! :)
I do miss each contributor having an angle behind the casting. 	I agree. As much as I enjoyed this set, the episode has a better flow with the angles each caster had. Also, I think I prefer it with Joe running it and participating as opposed to having a separate host. 
If my heroes can’t see past their darkness, how do I know if I will be able to?	Everyone is different. I hope you can find something that works for you. Never give up hope, and don't be afraid to reach out to friends or family or some of the groups up top.

Which Hypervisor? They all handle resource scaling a little differently. As a rule of thumb I stop at 60&amp;#37; CPU utilization, but that isn't a hard rule.

Any thoughts on oil as makeup remover? I've heard Olive oil, coconut oil, mineral oil and jojoba oil can all be used as makeup remover but with varying results and pore clogging. What do you use? Any recommendations? I'm trying to move away from wipes to something less wasteful.	I just use plain ole baby oil (mineral oil). No pore clogging, dissolves all makeup instantly, no matter how waterproof or whatever. I just follow up with cerave face wash to remove the oil.

It's been bad for the NBA because it forces teams to have super teams to be competitive. What this does is make 90% of NBA teams irrelevant. The only teams that have a chance are Warriors, Rockets, Celtics and whatever LeBron's team is. 	You should trust the process!

It seems like an insignificantly small amount. The only people that developed mesothelioma are those that worked in the factory for many years. Just put on a mask and remove it if it bothers you. Also do the box fan and 20x20” furnace filter trick as well then throw away the filter after. 	Yeah. But a mask on double bag it and put it in the trash.  Nothing to worry about. 
Do you think they purposely left out party members for the Frozen world in the trailer, or do you think we will not have any join in the final game	Well Elsa seems like she'll be the final target, rather then a party member.  As for Anna and Christof, I can't really see them as much of fighters. I'm guessing we'll get an Olaf summon at the end though.
It even looks better on your drawing!	Thank you :) 
This is sweeeeeeet! Incredible Hulk #1 homage right?	Yes indeed.
It's a legit gen 2 shiny as well. 7/10/10/10. Bronze didn't boost this one.	So this was a full-odds TPP shiny? How many of those have we ever caught?

I'm planning on starting my keto diet very soon. I'm going to make a green shake which consists of kale, celery, cucumber, pear, and ginger every morning for breakfast along with some eggs. Now on the keto calculator I'm supposed to be taking in 36g of carbs but this drink takes up 30g. While doing my research I saw that I should eat a ton of leafy greens so my question is should I scrap it and consider other low carb options to hit my calories goal or since that it's mostly leafy greens ignore those carbs?	The pear is probably where the high carb count is coming from. Sounds like a good smoothie, otherwise. A medium pear has 27 carbs on its own. Could you just not include it?
I’m from Auckland too fam and still researching before I make my first haul. Thanks knowing that someone from NZ is here too!	Yeah sweet as, good to know for me too. We can all help each other out.

What is material of your coil? Some people can feel metallic taste of some materials and other will be fine for them. You can try another material and check for results I don't use clapton coils, simple parallel, and usual I change my coils once per month, rewicking every week or so. They never taste metallic for me. Using kanthal.	 &gt;simple parallel as do I. simple is best. parallel spaced single coil is all I need 
"You should be interrupting your dps to heal, not the other way around" &amp;nbsp; I wish new healers would understand this more. A lot of healers I've met have played other mmos before where healers just.... heal, and they still want to stick by that mentality. Being able to dps and juggle/manage your oGCD with your co-healer makes healing in FFXIV so much more fun.	I am new to healing in FF14 and this was news to me. It made me go read up a bit more how to play Scholar, I realised I am doing a lot wrong.

I actually just got back from a cardiologist appointment as a matter of fact. I have to have a stress test and wear a heart monitor for three weeks. He didn't tell me specifically what it could be but I think he suspects some kind of Long QT syndrome. He mentioned the letter L when discussing things which makes me think it might be [JNLS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jervell_and_Lange-Nielsen_syndrome) or something along those lines.	Doubtful its jnls ... Thats usually noticed when your young. 
Ip Man. Then after that Ip Man 2. And finally bring it all home with Ip Man 3	If you decide to pass on ip man 3 don’t even worry about it though 
When she went under the truck I gasped.	I clapped
This made by the same people that did the Batman games?	No, Imsoniac Studios
This is university level? But you can answer this without even hearing the recording because you just select the one not stupid answer.	Yup. But the students who aren't listening to the recording probably don't have great English reading ability either...
Started on a 2017 Rockhopper Pro and stepped up to a 2018 Camber Expert. Absolutely love the Camber!	I made the same transition but my rockhopper was much older 
Took me far too long.  But I got there.	Are you bragging about your stamina?
B-But I was never exposed to any other form of media than DDLC. *please don’t roast me*	how
Honestly I'd love to see Silva back, but he wouldn't start over Bonucci or Romagnoli and with the wages I imagine he'd require we can't afford him for the bench. Besides, cb is probably the only position we have with really good bench options.	Came here to say exactly this! Great analysis ✌
How much is your tw dune?	I dunno what do you think is fair

Why don't you email them directly and ask?	all of my mates who had emailed the gic about any questions they had were never answered. thought i wouldnt waste my time trying to email them tbh

Love the fact that the news networks aren't able to keep up with all the words being thrown hahaha FCC gonna have a field day with this broadcast 	Fcc doesn't control cable. We're good. 
[Wand also.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jet_oYkXtgM)	Oh man, wand is so good. Lately I just can’t get enough of their recent ep perfume. 
Will this feature online play?	I think so because in the direct it said the Mii characters are being created so they can be played online or something.
Very nice article. After reading, I may try to incorporate Giff into my homebrew setting. 	That's so exciting to hear! Giff are super fun, and the setting they're from, Spelljammer, is just as weird and fresh.

This is just what you don't see on trucks anymore; 15 inch rims and AT tires. Looks so beefy and truck like just like its supposed to. Hope she goes 300k and beyond! Oh and I have an "old man" 2001 chevy s10 just hit 255k miles and Im counting on the next 255. 	It's actually on 17's and has 312,777 on it right now lol. Put a new transmission in at 275, hopefully the motor makes it another 100k
Torchwood?	I tried but didn't really take to it. Not a fan of Dr Who so it didn't help, sadly.
Can’t claim week six free tier.	Hidden location tier moved to the Soccer Stadium
I downloaded Linux using my AOL dialup accouint. It took two days and 12 floppies.	That is a golden sentence.
Not entirely related, but I hope people continue to let Julio slip for silly reasons. 	Pairing Julio with a consistent WR like Thomas or Allen is intriguing me this year

I always look forward to your posts... I guess you could call me a fan ☺️	Hahah I’m glad. :)
Done. Upvote this comment :)	 Hi guys, I need karma, I will upvote you back! 
both. arnold was the more talented coder and for the most part is the one responsibly for their minds being as complex as they are now. ford was the more creative force behind the hosts. he was the one obsessed with stories. its safe to assume he created most of their personalities, backstories and cornerstones with the exception of Dolores who seemed to be Arnold's personal pet project.	Great answers! Thank you for them.  I'm not sure, of course, if these points will be fleshed out, or made explicitly relevant, in future episodes, but I know that we'll be paying attention. Your answers make a whole lot of sense though.
You done my boy Waluigi wrong	You think Waluigi was done wrong? What about Bomberman? He would've been way more hype than Ridley. 
did they announce where the finals will be played	I'm willing to guess the Dallas Cowboys stadium.
It's felt like that for a while now but... is the author trying to establish Mikorin x Mayu as a new ship? Cuz I'm 100% for it.	Just so I'm remembering correctly, Mayu is Nozaki's younger brother? 
I've been looking forward to tonight's show for TAZ for months. My group bought tickets the day they went up. We just found out that the tickets are for tomorrows BMBMAM show and not for TAZ. Very upset. Going to miss TAZ. :(	I have two tickets for tomorrow night's show if you are interested
Thank you so much for sending me this. This book is absolutely gorgeous and I still cannot believe you were gracious enough to send it to me free of charge, covering the shipping and just being this kind to a stranger. Thank you!	You deserve it &lt;3 Now go, and hunt the night! 🦇🦇
Capt'n explain?	People have realized the theater of blood doesn't scale, meaning, it's very hard for small teams or unexperienced players, this reduces the number of players doing the TOB by a lot, upon realizing this, many players sell their pvm gear, making the prices drop.
Keep the burns coming ladies!	I don't even want to burn here, I just feel bad for you dude. I guess in true Fallout style, lasers are always an option? 
i believe once a trap is placed if the player is against the wall opposite it, it won't activate until they step closer. that's why he stayed careful to hug the wall until he broke free.	Yeah, I figured that's the case but I hadn't ran in to this issue before so it just seemed very odd. I assumed that the range would be exactly one tile and not like 4/5 of a tile or whatever.
From what I've read from the comments in this sub, since I have wondered the same thing, the general consensus is that you will know. They said it will feel painful along with swelling. I think one person said they didnt feel a thing though. You can ask your surgeon to do a lachman test 	Okay gotcha 
A proper Animal Crossing game.  Still salty that they didn't put one on the WiiU.	It makes perfect sense though. With the amount of grinding Doubutsu no Mori requires it only makes sense to put it on a handheld, now that they have enough power (3DS) to play a game like that without sacrifices in gameplay or visuals.
you need to stand at the prompt and then take a manual photo - and i THINK the description for that particular photo may give a hint toward what you're supposed to take a photo of. iirc that was the one that says something about "remembering the fun times" or something like that, if you stand at the prompt and look around with the free cam, toward up left of the fountain should be a billboard.  take a photo of that. I THINK that's the one you're talking about.	Well I finished the quest. there's no billboard near the fountain; what i did was in manual camera mode, I switched view so that the fountain's statue/podium, Noct, &amp; Prompto are captured in the photo
Rockin Bob's in Davis. He has worked on several of my 60s/70s Fender amps and done a great job. As u/3LandCruisers pointed out you will pay more than $100. 	Thanks for the rec. How much more, do you think? I'm not optimistic that I'll get more than $500 for the amp so at a certain point it's not worth it. What I'm looking for is more like long-belated maintenance than a major repair job.
aww hope u feel better 💕	thx :)
May or may not have cried during the credits 	I was full on bawling. 
Can you post a picture of this tiny little device?  I've worked in phone repair for years and never heard of something like this.	I'm with you I do phone repair and have never heard or seen anything like that
Bought the cowboy bebop one and now this one. The art work is great!	Oh wow! Thank you so much for the support :D
Only reason I would go sorcery after the celerity nerfs is to do the transcendence CDR stack cheese build. I feel like boneplating chrysalis is too good to forego, and if you want offensive then precision extra damage to low health targets also seems too good to avoid. But try it man. Report back.  	Does ult deal more dmg if you have Coup De Grace?
Iron Maiden Vs Rammstein in the first round, ouch	That whole bottom\-right corner is pretty brutal. I gotta say, whichever of the 4 emerges from there is probably favourite to win.
have you tried fapping trust me it tires you	Can confirm 
For some reason I read "Luigi", too much Smash.	Or the fact that about a week ago there was a "Luigia" on this sub lol!
I have upvoted. Please upvote me, Thank you.	Done,thanks

I got to buy Saint Laurent boots because I cant wear peasant boots like everybody else!!!! /s	don't talk 2 me unless u own a full rick outfit!!!
Can't be wrong if you didn't vote for either one.	Yeah you can, cause indifference means your vote could have changed the election. Probably wouldn't have, but it could have. Practice your right to vote!
Well, their loss dearie...I hope you have a long and happy marriage and life and all without them!	Thank you! Yes their loss. They have tried contacting me since and just rug sweep the whole situation but I ignore them. We now have a little baby that they won’t get to meet. 
Seriously why is everyone in this thread giving so much stick. These guys are not world beaters. They are the best their country has and are giving it their all. Just appreciate the entertainment rather than constantly complaining that someone miscontrolled or was too slow.  	Everyone's giving their opinion of the game and you're the one complaining 
Found one of the students in the 11% lol	How does "it's not impressive that you passed" mean that OP didn't pass? That joke doesn't even make sense...
Guess I'll hold off on switching mains to Shaman.	Have been levelling a Highmountain Tauren to main as Shaman in BfA ...
Wait, student pilots use rudder?	Only the left one. That’s why it broke and the right one was just fine.
Didn't even look. Trading Lillard is not an option.	They did it as a goof.
Hey buddy, here's a link to my latest video. I've been posting travel vlogs for about 6 months now. I think my main flaw is that I can be a bit too prescriptive in my PTC - when I should probably try and relax and have more casual conversation. But I'm still learning! Would love some honest feedback! Thanks bud! https://youtu.be/Pq3rjPh14DI	 Wow.. this is awesome.  
2 spectre + Hex? Not bio or tora sorry	no thanks i accepted another offer already. thanks for the offer tho
Wanted to make a little shrine to the ff games I had. My favorites are X, XIII, VII and VIII I almost wish I still had my copy of XV to throw up here along with the others. I've never played any of the games under 6 so I've been wondering if I should try them? One half of me wants to finish the collection but the other half of me really loves the sifi future themes of the games 6 and up.	Don't you forget about playing IV, OP. It's an essential FF experience.
You think Pablo Honey is better and has better production than OK Computer?	That was a joke, hence the quotes 
I tried to buy something off them from outside the US just because they accepted crypto. Turns out they don't actually accept it, they just accept it from US/Canada, everywhere else is a no. 	Interesting, I wonder why that is. 
Spree is now 100% my favorite player in the league. His Zarya is the stuff of legends, his D.Va is totally fine and apparently now he can play a serviceable Pharah? Plus he has a fun bravado about him, and he does silly stuff on camera like rubbing his hands together or miming crushing someone with a fist.	He is so entertainment, it always a pleasure to see him playing
big mistake	Yes it is
No drawing, we know where that will lead. Instead, have the number of kills a player has on the face	no please let me draw i must have the last thing my opponent sees is a robot with the unthinkable on it, the most horrifying thing you can think of, drawn on it's visor. ^^^. ^^^. ^^^. ^"owo"
Great moments in CFL history: June 14th, 2018: the game of boatball is invented after Investors Group Field became the first football stadium to be converted to an outdoor swimming pool. 	Will they bring back [the boat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfE2MwmdxJE)?
There are somewhere near 1,000,000 words in the English language, and even I, as a writer cannot string any of them together well enough in such a way that accurately describes how much I didn’t want to see this	Easily the worst thing I could have seen and I’m browsing r/wtf
It might be the problem is with the fact that you are checking is\_on\_floor() and doing jump in \_process() I get it that you are doing it that way cause you don't wanna miss but if you only want perfect input use \_input() to set a jump variable and use that in \_physics\_process(). From what I know is\_on\_floor() gives true once the check has been performed by the move\_and\_slide() So using a function that's called differently can cause some issues. Although I am not sure for myself of everything here. Cause the code seems fine. Cause you player seems to be doing a small jump on landing	Using \_input(event) and a variable seems to have fixed the problem. Thanks for the help!
Or there is the comprehensive document.	What. I'm talking about new updates that people find, i.e. the April Fools update that could have easily just been a joke
Curvy and thicc nowadays seem to mean grossly obese so no thanks. At least if someone is described as flat you know what you're getting	I still feel that thicc still holds some of it's meaning.
Loved the dialogue Holden and Miller had about if he was still alive when Eros went down. I think that was new for the show, and it was really affecting. Also hey, how did Miller appear that last time? After the Martian gets turned to goo, Miller appears and says "now or never" while the other three marines are still in the room. Does it work if Holden faces away and can't perceive anyone else? 	I believed it relied on Holden not interacting with other people, but that doesn't make much sense given he talked with Miller with Bobbie on the phone.
Oh - I forgot about this cover.	DC was really trying to experiment at this time and expand its apeal.  This was as big of  deal as anyone had done at this point, with secial paper.  I'm not always fond of the glossy paper they use now.
No Tanahashi I don’t accept 	There is a significant lack of both love and energy in this list. NO ACE :(
Who? 	He's the host of the Nerdist podcast, one of the big ones. Plenty of interesting interviews there with A listers and comedians.
My bars are pretty rubbish, lol: https://i.imgur.com/Tl0Z7X8.png	Mr DPS, I don’t feel so good....
A genie appears. He grants them three wishes. I can't continue this because I don't know the parties well enough to make it funny	Neither does OP. Might as well try.
The wheight of all the meme blood he has on his hands, keep him awake at night.	Lol, you're not innocent, just mean
Hard to find under $8 near me. If you have a sprouts market nearby, they have a store brand that they sell for $2.50. I stock up every time I go there.	What is the name of the Sprouts brand sauce? I haven’t seen it in my local store but I’d love to beg the manager to stock it!
Hey the song at 14:00 is the best of these, the vocals are upfront, adlibs are panned and executed pretty well and the mix is overall pretty nice and cohesive. The rest of the album I wasn't feeling much you seemed more in your element in that 1 track. 	Dude, thank you so much for the response. I really did gravitate to this track the most, so I'm happy to hear it sounds the most natural. I appreciate your feedback a lot!
Trade with u/Canadiantacos	Confirmed 
I like it. Really working for me. Whatever, it's fine. I think this is a case of patch notes being a little too sparse; it's like giving a pen full of hungry raptors a single sheep. You gotta give them more sheep so they don't fight. :)	Or at least explain why this one sheep is all they get (why the battery changed to this - pretty sure it was to avoid the old look, and thus avoid legal problems later on).
You got more?	I do! 😘 DM me if you're interested. 
Raven. She went about it wrong but she's sticking up for her friend and being loyal. Bekah, while she has valid points, has no business even being involved in the situation and dragging on Tia especially when she knows Tia can't respond because she's filming. It's not a fair fight.	I look at it is Raven not being worried about her friend, but more her inevitable appearance on BIP and how people will view her through Tia’s transgressions. 
Well I don’t have much but i usually walk miles and miles of train tracks collecting all the scrap metal that’s always laying around make quite of bit of cash doing it. Plus lots of exercise 	How do you carry all the metal that you pick up?
Can't wait for the Round 19 Saturday Night Blockbuster of Gold Coast Suns Vs Carlton at Metricon. Can't wait to see even if 5k people show up.	Lol. Why would 5k Carlton supporters travel? 
Brian Kelly has been one of Manly’s best this season with  Taupau and Jake 	He's def improved so much this year
&gt;they were met by some **200 teenagers** who had barricaded themselves inside, on the roof, in the basement and in the entryway Were these the Hilltop Youth?	Ha'aretz reported them as "extreme right activists", a wider description than "Hilltop youth".
Metal Cavern would be legit.	Metal Cavern is legitimately one of my favorite stages of all time. The music is so good.
I dont think it will be any time soon but I have a (hopeful) prediction on the direction it will take. I am hoping for a jazzy album with deep vocals. This mainly comes from the outro of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI0-1bw8f7w) of pork soda the vocals at [3:48 of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WdAaAhhb6M) of TOSOP (which I have seen elsewhere but cant find more sources). I just think it would be a really cool direction	I absolutely agree, I hope we get something like that. 
I get this all the time. I also feel phantom water dropping on me as well. 	Ouch, that must be annoying!
It looks amazing on you but I bet it looks better off ;)	Thanks! 
\*tastes like lies\*	I thought we should have just frosted a box, so there would be no cake.
It's only $18 (or maybe less if the GMG sale is still going on) I think you'll get more than your $18 worth out of it until Div2 launches, and that's assuming it doesn't get delayed...	Just bought it. I’m really surprised over how cheap it was compared to steam, it costed 14 pounds on GMG for the gold edition, compared to steam that wanted around 84 euros. So thankful, and thanks for letting me know about GMG, fantastic place.
Oh boy, can't wait for the cameras to show us Paris Hilton texting courtside 15 times a game again.	She hasn't been relevant since 2008...which was a decade ago.
I’m about an hour north, but 50... Have fun! SB is absolutely beautiful!	Lompoc? Santa Maria?
My advice would be to get fightpass, from there if you message me I can point you towards some great fights. Alternatively there is a guide on here.

Are you looking for downtown? My friend got her hair, makeup, and a spray tan all at Soiree salon in Cockeysville in preparation for her big day. Everything turned out amazingly! Hair and makeup on her and the bridal party were all flawless, and her tan looked great! I don't think they do home visits, but a bunch of us went to the salon for the hair &amp; makeup. You could probably schedule an appointment to meet your friends there and BYOB &amp; brunch!	Thank you! I will look into it, obviously if we need to go to a salon instead of being at home we can make it work. 
5 years later? This is good news...he'll remember my birthday and our anniversary. 	Lol. I like where your head’s at. 
Ouija boards	That should be a general rule in all households 
You guys need to get it in text or email from the people who have her that number, that they’re the ones who gave it to her. So if you guys need a RO or a CD, you’ll have proof that she was stalking. Because that’s what this is. Stalking. She knew she was being cut off and wouldn’t take no for an answer.  	Yep.
Has the challenger already fallen off of the cliff?	“We took it out to the back son, he’s gone now”

And when evidence was provided, they altered their world view. That's science. 	Indeed.
At my store it came, it failed, and we're back to the old way again. For now at least. Overnighters have also always worked on the grocery side too, cuz it's never finished.	So your off process? eh
Laughs at that baby Rust in Minnesota	I’m in ND and thought the same thing. That looks normal. 
My friend's car was stolen a few weeks ago and it was found in Mosby Court, along with their neighbors car...worth checking I guess!	I’ll have my husband look, thank you. 
I love the detail of the helmets. I wish I could buy just the helmets of all the buildable characters.	[here](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=bb826c01pb01&amp;idColor=80#T=S&amp;C=80&amp;O={"color":80,"iconly":0})
He was above 1k while I was watching	Wasn’t it incredible?I laughed and felt bad for King Bjorn a few times too. 
Maybe this has been answered before, but why is Pine listed as a flex player instead of a dps?	Because Pine is a backup for Jjonak. Pine also used to play the flex support role (Ana) for LW Red and Blue back during the Ana meta in Apex.
/u/ayellish, we will watch your career with great interest. ~/r/PrequelMemes 	This is where the fun begins
Isn’t that every day?	You're onto something there!
IIRC a few teams passed on Tarasenko cause they weren’t sure if he’d play in the NHL cause a few players went to the K I believe so us picking him was risky to an extent?	I'm glad you didn't listen, but he wanted you to take Panarin too.  That combo would have been amazing, especially with a guy like Backes as their center on clean up duty.
Very interested in calabasas longsleeve, could you measure the sleeves and total length please? Am from EU and willing to pay shipping.	Its 72 cm from neck to wrist
Is there any way you could get an echocardiogram or a holter monitor? Not all heart problems are obvious on an ekg. Did they do a CMP with your blood work?	I believe that they did do a CMP
There is too much diving.	Surely you enjoy a bit of Dark Vengeance on the pitch?
Just kidding he retweeted some guy calling it "based in racism" and agreed with him. Edit: Just realized the account he retweeted is "Modern Templar," as in someone who idolizes an era of Christianity that believed it had the divine right to slaughter Muslims in order to take back the Holy Land. 	Like Breivik.
I am not a sugar cookie getter! 	You know, I am a rapper.
Seriously blown away by the fact that it took two years for you to say this to your wife. Do people really get married in conditions like this?	We've been married for 12 years.  It was just often enough to keep me quite, plus i felt that if thats all she wanted i didn't want to pressure her for more. The timing just worked out to tell her how i felt. 
What an idea! Do you drill holes in the bottom?	No, I poked/cut holes in it since I didn't have a drill bit? that was big enough. There's five big holes and then a bunch of smaller ones.  
The sad thing is this is actual advice some people give, just worded differently. 	Yeah like “just retrace your steps”
Uh can you IMAGINE the endless fun and humor from future comedy bots? Once they learn our humor they can adapt to current events and regional interests.	[AWKWAAAAARD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9kDT44DBXs)

Could be against the federal government, but cool with local and state. 	Was ANTIFED taken? 
The men have the right to under go a rigged trial that goes infavor of the person with the most influence! 	Lol reasonable
Windows 7 isnt uefi compliant. Either switch it to legact/csm and turn off secure boot, or install a uefi os 	The only problem is that in the option to disable uefi and activate the legacy is blocked, I can not chance . I left leaving it and installed the Ubuntu. 👍

I read somewhere that when lending to a friend or family member consider it as giving instead. If they don’t give it back you’ve paid the price to find out what kind of friend or family member they are. 	True. Lesson learned. Thank you.

B350 chipset was made before ryzen 2xxx processors existed. The motherboard is compatible with Ryzen 2xxx processors **provided** you have a Ryzen 2xxx compatible bios. If your motherboard comes with a bios revision that's incompatible with a 2xxx processor, (ie. an early bios) you will need a ryzen 1xxx processor in order to update to a newer ryzen 2xxx compatible bios. * If you don't know anyone with a ryzen 1xxx cpu you can either try asking the store that's supplying the mobo to update the bios for you. * You can pay a store to update the bios for you. * You can apply to [AMD for a boot kit](https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/2Gen-Ryzen-AM4-System-Bootup.aspx) &amp; they'll send you an old CPU for free. * If it all sounds like too much hassle an X470 based motherboard is guaranteed to be compatible with a 2xxx CPU. 	Would you mind if I requested your opinion on a good X470? MOBO's have always been something I never quite understood fully. What features I need to look at.

Not gonna go with many expectations about the character creator, but I would try to make [something like this](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/52/2a/87/522a87fbc01a456fdbed9beede34e93e.jpg) or as close I can.	Pretty close to what [im going](https://orig00.deviantart.net/06e6/f/2012/007/d/5/molly_millions_wip_by_firstedition-d4lo1hp.jpg) for too.
I like what The Shadow of Angmar did with wands where the wood was hollowed out with a vanishing spell and then the wood was unvanished once the core was in. That way it isn't just a hollowed stick with a phoenix feather or something in it; they truly become one item.	Was coming here to reference this fic.

These are a few bands that I feel like are trying to keep that sound alive: [Superheaven - "I've Been Bored"](https://youtu.be/TeVYgjYYxBc) [Citizen - "Stain"](https://youtu.be/7Z6I_qGkGQ0) [Balance and Composure - "Quake"](https://youtu.be/VBllNOz2rhg) 	I feel those bands are more closer to modern emo than Sub-Pop grunge.
i've seen a lot of people wanting a mode like ranked but without ranks, and I like it too, but I suggest instead of a certain rank to get a charm/or nothing there should just be a list of like the top 100 or something	I mean, i still like how ranked works atm, but i'd like a version of ranked that isn't ranked. Mostly to try out new strats without risking precious rank, but also to help new or casual gamers get into ranked
How come one has a sight but the other does not?	He already has sikh aim.
It is not possible for your expectations to be too high for your first proper time on MDMA. You just didn't take enough.	It is possible. Depends on what the OP did previously substance wise
I'm glad he and other important religious leaders are condemning Trumps inhumane policies. More religious leaders should follow suit. 	The Methodist church rebuked Sessions for this, big Papa Francis is against it, I assume some crest ad televangelists will be for it, but all real religious leaders seem to be speaking against it. 
I think Ronaldo wants to win the World Cup, you guys.	Na he just wants to beat Rio Ferdinand in a game of table tennis
Anything that requires abstract thinking and creativity.	There are already bots that make music and art. [Emily Howell](http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/Emily-howell.htm) is an example of one that's been around for a while.
You’re 30 years old. I think you know what you feel. I will say though, take some time to yourself and figure out if you believe it’s real. After all, THE HEART WANTS WHAT IT WANTS. 	This is a great point. You're not 16, you're 30. You know who you are (probably, hopefully) and probably have a solid idea what you're looking for. Trust yourself a little. 
Looking for a shoe with the wonderful wide toe box of Altra yet still having up to 10 millimeters drop. Zero drop on long runs still hurts the next day. Thanks 	Right?! There would be a good market for the Foot-Shape toe box in a more tradition (or even middle range) drop.
I keep reading stories of people completing this with 3-4 randoms like its easy. I tried that for 2 hours yesterday, with several groups of randoms...some in fireteams some not....and I never got past round 2. And before the comments come in: I couldn't MIC up because I had young ones that I needed to at least acknowledge their existence from time to time.	As far as your mic situation, you might consider push-to-talk. I always have tons of noise and people I'm talking to in the background, so it's great for controlling when my mic is active
looks vv noice, with a dark theme to it	Thank you :)
Remember, if the name is dumb, we won't care. Oh who am I kidding, we won't care anyways 	I already don't care and I know virtually nothing about it. Based on my observations most others around will feel the same. I'd rather go watch a D1 UTSA team play than watch this type of league.
it's been doing this a lot to me too, I'm not sure what causes it but even restarting the app doesn't remove it	Playing something from the album fixed it for me. 
Jim jefferies is awesome.	He's pretty okay.

From what we know, probably a small antimatter charge encased in Cesium. The magnetic containment for the antimatter could also keep the Cesium from coming in contact with ambient water vapor -- unless it was fully submerged, in which case it would react explosively with the water, disrupt the magnetic containment, and set off the antimatter charge. I'm not sure why Starfleet security sensors wouldn't detect the antimatter, though.	&gt;Thomas Harewood He was Section 31 so it stands to reason he would have known how to circumvent security measures, or had access to tech that allowed him to do it.
Wilt chamberlain has to be up there. Reportedly slept with 20,000 women in his lifetime. A more interesting question is how many current NBA players are actually his illegitimate offspring?	G.kahn had lower standards
What i am going to attempt. Tell me if you think it will work. If he has a Bethesda account get his detail and buy it while in his account and send detail to his e-mail. If not open one for him with all his detail and send it then to him.	Yea that's an option.
Are they sending you money and telling you to use that money to buy these things? If so, STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP. THIS IS A SCAM. In a couple of weeks you'll find out the money they sent you was no good -- it doesn't matter that the check "cleared" within a few days. If it was a check, you will be in trouble with your bank and you will be fully liable for the money you spent.	Lol. No not at all. I have been with my company for over a year and just got accepted for a work from home position.

People cycling not for sport but because of DUIs, typically on a beat up BMX bike way too small for them.	Not just DUI'S, but bc that's literally the only means of transportation for them aside from their feet Also usually have 3-4 massively filled Hefty trash bags full of recyclable cans/bottles tied to the handle bars and their backs 
The best solution I've found to this problem is make it so disenchanting a chicken trophy gives 200/200 hp armor over 4 seconds or something.	This is a great idea
My husband and I both will wear an outfit entirely from Costco on a regular basis. No shame. We both like to dress relatively fashionable and are able to find pieces at our local Costco for such good prices. A coworker who ONLY shops at Nordstrom regularly compliments me on my outfits and its consistently surprised that I get dang near everything from Costco. 	Right?! For our grand opening we had some Burkenstocks that were near $100 off Nordstrom’s price. We sold $42,000 worth of them our first day!
The process for dual degrees is very school-dependent. For example, at my school you can't take any classes for your master's/PhD until after 1L classes, so their application is completely separate and it's a matter of working with your academic advisor. Other schools, you apply to both at the same time. It all depends. 	PSU? aye man, same. I was gonna apply for the JD/MIA program
This picture makes me smile!  Thanks for brightening my day :):):)!	You're very welcome!

Didn’t turn out the way I wanted it to,  but I wanted to contribute to the thread.  https://i.imgur.com/GyoLfuR.jpg 	This ma favorite submission in this thread, it made me smile. It's kinda nostalgic to me in a 70's retro way. It reminds me of a pile of clown clothes with suspenders. 70's clowns were usually always sad. So that's what I interporate. Thanks! :D

Get a dip pen, or fit a dip nib into a fountain pen. Know that any pressure at all is going to give you a way thicker line, and upstrokes are going to be scratchy.	Thank you for the advice.

Heidi, by Johanna Spyri You'll long to hear the robber bird, and go down the mountain bundled up on the Alm Uncle's sled! Plus, there are sequels. Written by her translators, but still.

*Reads Headline* Huh there must be more to this story. *Reads Article* Nope. She was literally detained 2 weeks for simply crossing the border accidentally which is just a misdemeanor. Nice job guys, I love seeing my tax dollars go to good use. /s Edit- Holy Poutine Batman! I get it, she broke the law but a lot of you guys are missing the point of my comment. She legit accidentally crossed the border. She wasn't resisting or anything, wasn't a threat, and was cooperating. Her mother showed up with her identification yet, she was held for two weeks because of slow bureaucracy on both sides. Whether you lean right or left, you've got to agree that this is a messed up situation that shouldn't be happening. 	I can’t help but notice she looks just a little err tanned, almost a light brown...

Even charging for the reusable plastic bags, the overhead is likely more expensive then the stores with the single-use plastic bags.  I know at my retail store we paid $25 per box of 1,000 plastic bags and over $100 per box of 500 paper bags. I know at one point Target was offering a minimal discount (I think 5 cents a transaction) if you brought in a bag.  They haven’t done that in awhile so obviously the promotion never took.  If the stores are going to try and promote reusable bags, a significant promotion is going to have to happen - something companies aren’t going to pay forever.	I’m pretty certain Target is still doing a discount for bring your own bag. I got 10 cents off last time I visited and brought my bags. 
Wait, who’s gonna write an essay about Grubauer?	He has the best save percentage in the NHL at 5 on 5 over the last two years. You don’t need an essay to back up that.

Should be fine as long as you study consistently throughout the semester and at least 5 days before midterms. Make sure you take phy132 with meyertholen, he's the best and I enjoyed the course a lot. For 131 I had wilson, so basically had to teach myself, try to do the exercises in the book and be on top of the material. A lot of people get discouraged about taking 132 after 131,  but 132 is way easier, so keep that in mind.	thanks!!

Criticism is fine, but nearly none of the complainers have been doing it right. The right way to do it is to complain while being constructive... most if not all of the complainers in here do not understand that, they're never constructive, they're just toxic. 	Agree completely. I’m fine with criticism if it’s done in a productive manner. In fact I encourage it, as long as it hasn’t been said a billion times already.

Jarvis is the most valuable and important piece of tech Tony Stark ever created, after that is the arc reactor and then his suits are a distant third. Seriously if he made copies of Jarvis and got them to run city infrastructure and diagnose diseases and pilot swarms of drones and basically solve everybody's problems all at once he would basically change the world overnight. The only reason for those suits is his massive ego.	So... Skynet.
Very nice build. The thing I love when someone builds their own spaceship is the lore around it. Does this one have one? Things like: What the purpose of the ship is, what armaments does it have?

Because I am not pro-gamerman, I wound up getting a grand total of three characters in my playthrough of the demo.  Primrose was the second character I picked up, and I'd say that, of the three, her story is my favorite.  I mean, sure, revenge stories are done all the time, but this one...something about it is compelling. Plus, since I started with Alfyn, my playthrough thus far has wound up as an interesting juxtaposition of idealism (the young Doctor who wishes to help everyone, and heal everyone) and cynicism (the vengeance fueled dancer, who wishes to hurt those who have wronged her, and who relies only on herself).  I imagine the dialogue between these two characters, the way they'd interact, and it's fascinating. It is quite possible I need to get a hobby. 	&gt; It is quite possible I need to get a hobby. and that hobby should be playing Octopath Traveler ;)
In narrative or open play, totally! In matched play? Maybe. If his base is the same size, it's probably okay.	Yeah base is the same.

hello what special hero should i get next from the 6* special hero selector? i have aris and eileene already, was considering between rachel, spike, ace and dellons.	A single Atalanta can complete your Raid team. Or if you somehow dont have a.Ruri (not a priority) definitely pick Ace first so you can level up your DD difficulty for more daily awakening shards. Best part, you’ll only need a single copy of them.

Whenever I see "realistic" Simpsons I think of how Homer's childish antics wouldn't be as lovable if he weren't drawn to be so round and cute; rather than the James Gandolfini looking guy he generally represents.

Closest thing to the room in gaming that I can think of is Deadly Premonition. 	It would get my vote.
Funny thing is that it was largely fine until some started complaining that it didn't offer full 3D flight mechanics. So DE patched that in, along with inertia. That turned the experience into a stinking mess, so DE put in the "experimental flight" settings switch (now what part is or isn't experimental there is effectively lost to history) but retained the inertia. And this is where we currently find ourselves.	I'm guilty of thinking control changes would be neat. They were not. They were terrible. Just reset archwing to how it was before them and it's automatically a lot less bad, and we can focus on map, enemy, and other issues.

I just bottled a brew like this too! First time I ever had such good carb in F1. There was even a huge bubble trapped in the pellicle layers. It was tricky to bottle because it kept overflowing with foam. I think my brew must enjoy the hot weather, though it's a bit much for me.	I'm getting similar carbonation without the pellicle formation. Any idea why?

Your question is like asking "what are the human words for mother and father"? Just like humans, the elves don't all speak the same language. The two major elvish languages that we know about are Quenya and Sindarin. The normal Quenya words might be **amil** and **atar**. In Sindarin: **naneth** and **adar**. Note that there are many other words and variants of these words. https://www.elfdict.com/w/mother https://www.elfdict.com/w/father	Sindarin's "mother" should rather be ***emel***, as _naneth_ is actually Noldorin (aka Sindarin's draft), found in the Etymologies (~1938).
I haven't played Overwatch since Moira dropped, so I'm a little rusty, but PM me your PSN name and I'll add you. I usually only play on weekends, just FYI.

I think the movies influence my imagination the locations more of the characters. When I read about Diagon Alley, The Burrow, Hogwarts or any of the shops I imagine it the ways the movies represented them. The characters go back and forth from the movies to my own imagination depending on the time between viewings and readings. But the locations remain the same. 	Agreed, I feel the same way
Equally annoying: when I paste in a deckstring for which I am missing some cards, there's no easy way to replace those cards with empty slots. I have to replace them with one of the three terrible auto-choices it gives me, then remove that auto-choice from the deck.	You can just drag out the missing cards, you don't need to replace them first.
Looks like an excellent start.	Thanks! It’s not everything, by any means!

Low level accounts needs much longer because matchmaking tries to pair you with other low levels and there arent many. It gets better with higher level.	Thanks, I'll just keep playing then. Do you have any idea around what level it stops trying to make me pair with really low level players? 
“Kicking”	It's a knee kick
Has anyone else commented on the fact that she looks just like Nicole Richie? 	Definitely stated in our household
Looks the same.	Gave me motion sickness back then, still does it today. 
Did they announce any cheap RMT bundles?	with the recent value bundles costing lapis and no lapis bundles in sight AND step up anniversary banners i'm getting ^mildly worried
Man, personally, I would flirt with her at the group event and see how she responds. If she's receptive, then you ask her out on a date. If she's not into it, then no harm done. Rejection is a natural part of this process, you'll have to get used to it. 	I’ll try to flirt more today I’m actually picking her up from school and I’m going to ask her if she want to get chipotle or something.
Why didn’t they just put them down instead?	I think you meant to say her instead of them.
They have pickaxes too	And building why is building not on there?
Allegedly, that's ignorant.	Look it up it’s real.
On Anivia you can take wall at level 4 and get it to rank 2 at level 8, then continue to max E, then Q, and finish wall. Though thats because a level 2 wall is worth so much more than a level 1 wall, but a level 3 wall isn't worth much more. Not a lot of Anivia mains do this though, I've suggested it to some and seen a few others do it.	Same arguments for ASol E. Rank 2 E has just enough distance to reach other lanes from a good distance. More points are worth less so you out them in after maxing W&gt;Q.
12 team ppr, non sf. Josh Gordon or mike Williams and a 2019 first	Give me Gordon. Unless it's a top 3 pick next year.
Bought another Butter Bronzer. I bought one for the first time about six months ago and returned it because the smell was overwhelming. For some reason, I bought another one last week. I let it sit out for a few days to get rid of the smell, and now I quite like it. 	Thanks for the tip! I just picked one up the other day cause I'm starting to get into bronzer and I hear about it allllll the time across all makeup subreddits. The smell is fine to me it's just... a lot.
The late mid 2000’s were a simpler time	&gt;late mid 2000's Say that again... But slower. 
How do you change your guild name anyway?	The current guild leader has to send a request to support.
Confirmed? If so I wasn’t expecting 25 songs. Wow. 	Yeah confirmed, I wasn’t neither haha. It’s a double album being rap and r&amp;b
Sneezing when you are on your period.	And/or sneezing and dislodging a tampon. 
This is funny &amp; sad at the same time hahaha	*Grabs at air* 😢
Gorgeous before and after!	Thank you! 
Congrats to everyone who didn't panic sell yesterday	I panic bought, not sure it’s any better.
Short answer is yes, because laws are weird, but probably not. If you have such a thing I would definitely get rid of it. 	I don’t, thankfully! Was just curious if there were any legal loopholes. Thanks for the response :)
It's just the risk of being the shotcaller. I've found teams listen more to the carry of the team or somebody who just shows dominance. As a support player my calls get ignored but if you make the logically correct decisions you'll find that someone on your team acknowledges it as well. It's important to never spam ping the objective or idea because you'll just aggravate your allies more. Also unless you can build a friendly communication between allies don't speak heavily in chat. Keep talk restricted to key points and try not to answer back if people question it.	have you got spare steam keys before
What a waste of time, typing down all this nonsense 	Why, it's to express my thoughts and to offer a discussion topic. And if this is a lot to read for you, well... I am sorry to hear that. Also, it's "nonsense" why? Because you disagree? Quite closed-minded of you.
Flag makers rejoice 	Just combine north and South Dakota or something. I don’t even know why they’re two different states. 
I have vids but it won’t let me upload 	Upload to mega!
Could also mark as a spoiler I guess	Done, thanks!
This looks great! I especially like how perfectly the coat layers with the dress.	Thanks!
$450 total for just yourself? (Like a 1BR or studio) Or $450 per room with a roommate?	Around 450 alone 
After Abby mentioned Moonlighter, I looked it up and it looks great. Definitely going to keep this on my radar. Thanks, Abby!	I missed the title and was sure she was talking about [Recettear](https://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/Recettear_An_Item_Shops_Tale/)

Have you tried reaching out to your HR rep? I automatically received a brochure in the mail with directions and choices for my 5 year milestone. You can also try keyword "milestone" on the intranet. I'll DM you the email that I show for service awards. 	Mind sending me that too? I lost my milestone brochure in my move. 
They were scared for their lives.  	If only there was an armed teacher there to protect the little snowflakes.
Hey this post is in earnest, I opened a CDP with a liquidation at $365 at $565, really believing it was a bottom. I'm nervous now and can I lower my lower liquidation point? Lock up more ETH in it somehow? I'm using EasyCDP	You can either: 1) Lock up more ETH 2) Buy DAI and "wipe" some of the debt. My understanding is that using DAI will reduce the liquidation more than depositing ETH 
The better KCM game from today is Jaedong vs. Mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHHGm7y6cQs	It's usually great games between those two. Thanks for the heads up. 
Just made me think. What is happening to strikes with caydes voice lines? 	Nothing? Why would they change?
I can honestly say i havent had one. But i have seen instances of people crashing at the same time even prior to this update which could be server related. 	Yep i crashed too with friend in same time.

I was looking for this guy all day, Anyone know the odds of it being shiny this weekend?	I caught 2/150 random spawns at the same park today.
since you said real talk, I would advise against the 5-7, unless oyu have *really* big hands.  The grip is easily the most uncomfortable one that I've held. That being said, you should still be able to find a few old marui ones or even a maruzen if you look around the asian sites, but replacement parts will be tough to source.	I got *M O N S T E R* hands.
Duclair	Yeah I like him too. I hope the Kings pick him up.
I literally just commented on another thread that I thought they looked the same. Do you think it's the same dress??	Anna wore her sister’s wedding dress. Lauren’s was purchased it said so in the press release. 
He just won. Throw his stuff out the window.	The stuff did nothing wrong, throw him out the window.
I recall him holding out against the pay cut. He was there for some time so it's fair enough he moves on. I wonder where he'll go. He is very talented. He'd be ideal on some interview show, as long as he can dig deep.	[Yes, Eddie was 'last man standing'](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/31/bbc-infuriated-delay-radio-4s-eddie-mair-wage-cut-following/)
Art critic.	Only if your readers aren't artists themselves
If you build it....	Definitely should name him Tachyon.  Came before we built it.
Yeah it's gunna be a no from me dawg	Several even. At varying degrees of loudness too. 
Torchwood boy also gives good reaction/reviews. He always has realistic reactions and insightful comments. 	Thank you - I will check these out too!
Cold Hard Crash flashbacks	Exactly! But that box is not hidden anymore. :&lt;
I hope Valverde utilizes Rakitic more in an offensive role rather than just a second pivot with Busqi in 4-4-2. Hopefully he'll use him as Enrique did in 14/15 and 15/16 seasons. 	That will be hard if Coutinho becomes our LCM.
Well, saying thanks does qualify here. 	Came here to say something quite similar. 
Houston and OKC seem to be a bit preoccupied and haven't discussed it all that much. The rest... well.	We don't dabble much in the affairs of peasants. Hallowed be Harden's beard. Blessed be Westbrook's triple doubles.
Dunno why I always thought Benedict was taller than Tom	It is weird in this picture. Tom is taller, but only by 2 inches. This makes him look significantly taller. 
He’s so handsome. What’s he like?	He’s still very energetic. Very intelligent.  Our son Joshua got him when he was a freshman in college.  
DC looks like the world's worst bank robber	Ahhhh, yes... The *Home Alone in New York* vibe. The epitome of physical intimidation.
Show power lvl pls	Its like around 155k
Got a hot tip from u/ordanation. I’m fairly sure he didn’t meet Chantel until ~~2016~~. ETA: here’s the whole album with the ring pic where it should be. It’s just weird that his first Chantel pic is after he’s wearing a wedding band (that only appears in that one photo and nowhere else in that range). https://i.imgur.com/ZxO0luy.jpg https://i.imgur.com/nVfoGQY.jpg https://i.imgur.com/mfdzKo9.jpg https://i.imgur.com/b8DxzMu.jpg https://i.imgur.com/XgV4nuJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/JhqbnXO.jpg https://i.imgur.com/r5OpUIw.jpg https://i.imgur.com/hBsoPNG.jpg https://i.imgur.com/r5G78RW.jpg 	HIs FB has pics with Chantal dating back to mid-2014.

Has she tried reapplying yet? My association had something similar, I was kicked out but reapplied, and now I'm registered twice and count as two people. I think she should be able to reapply, as long as she has the ID!	The same happened to me, turned out we couldnt kick the extra one so I left then rejoined, fixed it completely
Wonder if it's possible to get to the kiln using this or a similar boundry break	I think there is with the parry camera glitch like is done for sens skip. But it's much less reliable to pull off.

I like the shield better for carry because of the shorter barrel.   i wish the "compact" was actually a compact and had a shorter barrel  	If the compact was any more "compact" with a shorter barrel....  It would be a shield!!!
I stopped making analogies. I used to be that guy who was always it's like this and like that and like this and uh.	Why though? Analogies are useful.

Are you just looking for some form of passive income? Check our Payfair. Around 250 for a trust node and requires nothing besides an ethereum wallet to run. Pays dividends from the escrow and p2p exchanges held through the site. I think everyone should have one	how much do you get from this?
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I also think there have only been 3 teams that have won a championship with a team that had zero players that ever got an MVP in their career. Those three teams? Pistons 89, Pistons 90, Pistons 04	1979 Seattle SuperSonics is another one

Oh wait I get it. Nick keeps getting told he needs to improve his match fitness so he deliberately lets it get to tie-breaks before he starts to try. Once again Nick has proven to be a genius. One step ahead of us all.	Its not a bad idea tbh. His serve and clutchness more often than not will give him a leg up in most tiebreaks

I really recommend you to play prestige, uTots, POTM, 10 elites and lots of things are obtainable more or less at 96-98 ovr so you would need to upgrade that team, it is a bit boring but totally worth.

I personally loved BO2 campaign, as it had multiple endings and an insightful commentary on our future. But I also loved WWII, and it doesn’t have the problems you listed. There is a tank and an airplane segment though, just letting you know.	BO2 was so fast they never let me enjoy any scenario. A setpiece starts and two minutes later it ends. It was too fast, too frenetic for me. If WW2 is different, then I should enjoy it. Thanks.
I'm in my late 20. I have 6 cards, with 60k total credit limit. My income is not that high either (around median full-time ), the cards and limits are super easy to be approved. I've never paid a cent in interest so I don't really care. CCs have brought a lot of convenience in my life. It's not the banks' fault that people use credits they are incapable of repaying.	I'm curious to know why you have so many? 
I got sober in AA. At the end of my drinking my idea of a great week end was to stay in bed for two days, not really sure if I was asleep or awake.  To me, zero phone messages meant zero problems. If I go to a meeting I work on my isolation and my drinking, because they go hand in hand. I drink because I'm alone, I'm alone because i drink.	I hear that!

Long term healthy living does not come from replacing one binge food with another. You have to do the work to change these habits.	But if one is going to be dreaded so much to need any little comfort already? Just something that comes to my mind suddenly. And, at least the food is changed from "complete-bad food" to "still-alright food".

Someone turn that valve and maybe we can get some games flowing again.	It can only be turned twice.
Use ADC for Master and Low GM. Kagura can't handle turrets well. Just let the everyone else do their thing, and give yourself the the responsibility of taking down turrets. The first time I played, I reached GM 1 with just Miya, she is still my most played hero  with 184 games. Some heroes you could easily use should be Haya, Natalia, Helcurt, Zilong or any mm. You just need someone who can tear down turrets real quick and get sneak outta there.	Thanks. I tried to try it for a game, 3 people instalocked mms. Managed to negotiate one to change to mage by telling them I'd tank. All bronze, I'm silver. Ggwp in less than 10 minutes.

The fact that these people were allowed to be a part of the parade is astonishing. What is this world coming to?	Rampant undiagnosed mental health problems.
There is a very good map for this riven : Koro on the Kuva fortress. At the beginning, you will have to 'burn' the door and defend it. During the defense, around 10 dargyn will spawn : 5 at east and 5 at west of the door. 	Good idea but its dargyn pilots. Not dargyns.  Pilots Are in plains only 
On the surface everything seems fine so far. Go for another date. If she wont be up for it (or gives an excuse) then give it up.	Yeah... was thinking same! Will prob give that a try!
**Complaint:** Can there be a ban on posts that begin with the phrase "Just ran"? There are so many of them, and they're all the same. Look, I get that you're proud that you ran X distance, but if each of the 450K+ subscribers posted every time they ran, the sub would be useless. **Complaint:** We could also do away with questions that can be answered with a Yes or No. Yes, you should run with a water bottle (or some source of hydration) when it's hot out. This is common sense.	&gt; (2) - Low-effort &amp; low-quality posts, recent reposts, chronically repetitive posts and posts not directly related to running are subject to removal at the moderation team's discretion. I'm just going to start replying to all the low-effort posts with this. I miss the times when Runnit had quality content.

He has become old and gray, and you remain beautiful and young, like an immortal being to him. I know he is happy that you are still young and healthy and send him off some day to the great beyond. He wonders if he will see you again because in his eyes you are immortal and ageless, a generous being that gave him this long, wonderful life. Bless your sweet squishfaced pugger and I hope you still have lots of time left on this little rock in space that we call home.	I don't know if there is an afterlife, but if there is. I wouldn't rush to family, or humans friends first. I'd go sit next to my first friend and simply enjoy time, gently rubbing his neck.

A few things from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/8ixhjo/anyone_on_sublingual_pills_for_years/dzbntr5/) might be discussed with med personnel in case. There may be some optimisations of hrt possible eventually. And concerning bioidentical progesterone there are a number of ways of intake and they can have different effects. Topical use can make for more local effects. Oral use can make for metabolisation of sleepy making components so some people use it in the evening. Best may be injections, they can make for some kind of smooth feeling in the background. And its also possible to adjust dosage in case. *hugs*	Thanks for your help &lt;3

Great tool! Is it intended that when you hit readd discard, it puts all the card still in the deck to opponent's hand? It makes sense gameplay wise after I think about it, but it sure feel strange at first sight.	Yeah it is a little weird, but I didn't want people to have to move half a dozen cards manually.  I should probably add an alt text or something to explain. Edit:  Added tooltip.
Question: Do the tags do anything gameplay wise or are they just fluff?	The tags mostly come into play with the events, and the 1.1 patch fixed the events so they are actually happening now.

Nebraska has a smallish student population. Huh	Omaha metro has roughly close to or half of Nebraska's population, so the population of each city drops dramatically after that.

Ask them about something they’re most proud of but rarely get to talk about. 	I decided I'm going to go through answer these when I'm bored. Nothing, I feel like pride clouds judgement.

Bandcamp is a much better service for artists. You get a much higher percentage of sales and have more control over distribution. Since Knxwledge already has an established fanbase, it probably makes more sense, money-wise. 	True true but all of his first stuff was there too

As someone who just jumped into the series at WHII due to a sale, is there a reason why its so much lower than WH1? Just because WH1 is older, or people didn't want to buy the newer one for some reason?	Age and price.  You can get WH1 for $15 during sales but WH2 doesn't go below $45.
I got tests at 4+3 - 273, then at 4+6 - 802. Doc never called me back, but my internet investigations lead me to think that's a good result! I only got 2 tests cause the Dr thought the first one was a bit low for how far along I was, but I think I ovulated a few days later than CD14. 	Yeah those look good!  Especially if you ovulated later.  I’m in a similar boat... I didn’t ovulate until CD21.  I’m using the conception date for timing rather than LMP, otherwise it’s a bit inaccurate for me.
Sounds good!  Have you ever heard of kodiac power pancakes mix? Im trying them out this weekend. 210 calories, 14 grams protein, 5 grams fiber.  1 serving says it makes 4 flapjacks. 	No I haven't but I'll look them up! Sounds awesome

I got it on sale for $20 a few years back, literally never touched it after driving a tank once	You sure that was a sale? Its undiscounted price has been $20 for a long time. ED just doubled it for no reason.
If Swaggy does get backdoored he isn't going to just sit lightly and walk away. One, he wants to actually stay in the game. Two, he wants to make a name for himself. I'm looking forward to what he brings to the table. Also there is a chance for a 6-6 vote Tyler, Brett, Angela, Rachel, Kaycee, Sam Faysal, Baleigh, Angie, Haleigh, Scottie, JC Which would end the week perfectly with Kaitlyn making the tiebreaking HOH vote. We would see if Tyler is worth more to Kaitlyn than Faysal, Haleigh and Angie combined. 	I don’t see JC being the one to flip. He’s been working to make sure Swaggy doesn’t get picked for veto. He doesn’t like him. 
Of course it's just below 5 mins xdd	R3 where u at
I, on the other hand, just missing Navas. Edit: and don't really have the top guys like Kroos, Bale, Modric, and Benzema lol. Just mostly Golds and Silvers.	then you don't need Navas , you need  KIKO CASILLA 
u/obviousplant  Not Nightvale.	It's Nightvale-ish. There's not anything specifically in the rules that prohibits it, and it does seem like something that you would expect to see or hear in Nightvale.
And? Disrespecting gang culture isn't a bad thing.	Mel Brooks would agree.
Woot I must admit I have a bit of super hero fatigue but I still might go see this because Paul Rudd and ~~Evangeline~~ Kate can do no wrong   	They are fantastic together in this one!

I’m somewhat more biased towards anime, but I’ma say: * _Kaiba_ * _Samurai Champloo_ * _Dexter_ * _Paranoia Agent_ Special mention goes to: * _Loveless_ * _Cowboy Bebop_ * _Tokyo Ghoul_ &amp; _Tokyo Ghoul:Re_ * _Victorian Romance Emma_ (both openings)	Yes!!

There will be Ships at Moisty 	There's a Viking that last it's anchor. We need to serve justice.
You forgot the addition of Forward Parry, which parries guard, and back parry, which parries shards away from your opponent and gives them to you. Also, upon successful parry, your opponent will lose one file at random from their system. This is to advocate true skill based rewards from parrying.	Oh sorry, you're right. Forsaken is so insignificant as a playstyle I must of overlooked that

Do you have any SFP’s handy? You can typically just plug em in and get tx/rx strengths off the optic diagnostic commands in your switch. For 80m you’re well within the distance allowed by 10g-sr, I’d at least give it a try. 	They're coming in next week. The strength info is this DOM feature some optics have?

This is not quite what you mean but I want to post just in case anyone can help. I used to love a website called cooking by numbers. It had a big list of things you might have in your cupboard/fridge/freezer and you tick what you have and then it showed recipes that included ONLY those ingredients. Great for cupboard clearouts or moving house. I've seen other websites where you search by the main ingredients (say beef, or tomato sauce) but then the suggestions have onions or herbs or other things in that they assume you will have. I know the actual site went down years ago, but it was such a good idea I'm surprised someone hasn't created a new version!	https://www.supercook.com/#/recipes ?
Never trust a druggie, if someone was after him then you did the right thing by kicking him out and not getting yourself involved. On the extremely off chance this ever happens again though I suggest calling the cops. If someone is after him then they can protect him better than you could and if he just had a mental illness then they could get him the proper help.	True, if someone is after him you can get in trouble too
Interested in purple too or just lime?	just lime.  I have purple  Thanks!
Read the codexs. At the beginning they give overview of that factions lore. As far as the novels good luck. The Horace heracy series alone is like 46  books at this point and still on going	The codexes, I'll start chipping away at those while reading "rogue trader".
Haha you haven't even had to start with MyGov yet!  Ooh boy you'll love that even more! 	Pretty much everything you do on MyGov has to contact those DHS/Centrelink systems at one point or another. That's the primary failure point of MyGov and is mostly why it is such a pain to use.
Good luck!!! I know it’s hard but just picture yourself in class with smooth clear skin! You’ll make a great impression either way, don’t hide because you’re afraid of judgement and be yourself. 	Thank you! I'll do my best :)
6k and add?	sure , add RavenFAILS on steam
Psychiatrist - didnt help. Also didn't know about about miso. Put me on anti-depressants (low dose), didn't help. Psychologist who knew about, it was okay. We did hypnotherapy stuff, first few times, things were alright, after that things went back to normal. 	That’s what I expected.. thanks for the response

I can't access Matthew and Fritz quests because the particular one was in Talmberg and I already finished main quest line. But, now after the latest patches Talmberg is now ok again, why I can't get the quests to move? Is it permanently blocked because reasons? I also see a star icon in front of the Sebastian custodian house in Sazau Monastery but there's no one to talk, and I already cleared the bandits camps for him.	Same
Honestly surprised they're not playing it at Kogarah. It would've been the only Kogarah game that I'd be keen to go to.	Kogarah is going to be great this year. Looking forward to it.
Is it worth it to get a 860Evo or a 850Evo (both 500 gb) if I should even get a SSD at all?	I think the 860 is usually cheaper new, but you can probably get a cheap 850 used.
I am hyped but we already had an announcement for the announcement last Friday. So I'm not sure why we need this thread when the news is literally what people want.	I'm just announcing as a follow-up to the announcement for the announcement. 7 minutes!!

I am unaware of any Fully Free and Open Source Keyboards. Think Penguin is fairly open source though: [https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/white-slim-usb-keyboard](https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/white-slim-usb-keyboard) I am unaware of any proprietary software that it uses. However I don't believe the hardware is Open Hardware.	Thanks!
It would be great, but I'd rather them spend time improving other areas. Unless the gas giants would have a purpose, or carried some exotic materials, they'd be just floating there uselessly, as you couldn't do anything on them.	We each have our priorities. Gas Giants aren't only thing I want but they seem like the easiest to implement. I've no idea if creating them is as simple as I believe.

What exactly does the NDP have to do with this story? It's about civic politics. There should have been 2 separate lists for corporate and union donations since they're very different things. And it shows that Edmonton has the same problem as Calgary. A cabal of shady developers back end bribing politicians.	why would two separate lists be necessary? 
Nice coincidence!  And make it double!	To protect the world from devastation!
Build Fighters Try. Seriously though, it's hard to top 08th MS Team in terms of both accurately showing the Gundam universe while not being too much. Outside of the UC I'd say 00 is a good starting entry; still Gundam enough but not too much of a departure. 	My concern with 00 would be how much of a soap opera it is. Like I would show it to my mother before I would show it to my father.

This is kind of why blanket detention of whoever seems suspicious can be kind of dangerous. It's not a hard line before this sort of thing happens. If US citizens were accidentally detained without cause once, it could happen again. 	The next step is they can just grab anyone, separate their kids and just *say* they were found crossing the border so they don't get a trial. Vaguely brown within 100 miles of the border?  You're potentially next

He will win MVP next season.	I know I’ll probably get flak for saying it: I want to see Davis playing somewhere other than NOLA. I don’t care who he eventually plays for, as long as it isn’t the Warriors.
How does it feel knowing the baconator is a Baconzilla knockoff?	Well, this seems to be the case, but (no offense) the Baconator is more structurally sound (I understand how dumb that sounds), as all the pictures of Baconzilla sandwiches I see are falling apsrt, but hey, its probably just a good.

I don’t agree with khabib being above Whittaker. I’m a khabib fan, BUT look at their last few opponents and Whittaker has definitely had higher level competition 	At the same time, Whittaker/Romero II could have gone either way, while Khabib decisively won all his recent fights.

I am disappointed that we don't get an explanation for why Laura goes back to being called 'X-23'. Like, if Gabby can be Honey Badger, surely she and/or Laura can come up with a better name than 'X-23' if she's abandoning 'Wolverine'. 	I need to re-read it, but I'm not certain she's actually called X-23 in the book, proper. It's the title, but that doesn't mean she's referred to by that moniker. I think she may just be Laura now. 
So, as x goes to infinity, the x\^2 terms are going to 'dominate' the linear terms (the x\^1) and the constant terms. So the limit is the same as 3x\^2 / 6x\^2.  Therefore, the limit is equal to 1/2. You should learn more about limits in PreCalculus.  You will use limits again and again in Calculus.  For the deep underlying theory, the material is called 'Real Analysis', which is short for Analysis of Functions of a Real Variable. TL:DR:  You will learn about this car in PreCalc.  You will learn to drive this car in Calculus.  You will learn how the engine works in Real Analysis.	Good response.  I especially like the car analogies.
Better to be silent and let people think you're stupid, than to open your mouth and prove it.	I believe this one belongs to Mark Twain. 
I think we should dedicate one day of the year as "Net Neutrality day" as a reminder and to raise awareness on this issue.	Unless that gives me a day off from work, I don't want any more days to celebrate.

Kerfing This is very common in my trade, so if you have a piece of 1/2” ply your bending, I’d set my saw to an 1/8 maybe a little more depending on the bend, than cut in 1” dashes for roughly 6-8” depending on what your corner length is. We use this application for a lot of custom home building where radius builds are extremely common, it’s a fun and interesting take on carpentry I recommend trying some kerfing yourself	Couple questions if you dont mind. Can you do this with higher quality woods?  I'm building a hope chest, could I use this technique for the front/back and sides, and build the box from one piece? Do you steam the wood prior to the bend?
THEY ACTUALLY DID IT. Not the kind I prefer but hey, at least it's something.

Ok, side question.....but what mall is this in Boston?	Looks like the Prudential Center.
Another alternative is a natural wood comb.  It will still soak up and move oils like natural bristle brushes, it’s just slightly less efficient at it.  Make sure it’s not varnished or laminated. There are lots of options. Bamboo, beech, and peach wood are all pretty common.	Thanks! I’ll look into that option.

hey man, if it makes you feel better, I didn't even go to college.  Life's been okay for me so far. No real stressful issues have come up for this 22 year old.

If I recall correctly type r’s like bigger boxes.  Have you already built it? Most people these days prefer to get down to at least 30 hz with some authority and that enclosure has a 41hz peak but drops pretty hard below.  I’d go up to 2.5 cubes and drop the tuning to 28-32.  It’s been several years, but the last enclosure I did with a type r was 2.75 tuned to 30hz and it performed good.  If your not after the lows though then it will be good.	I haven't, what do you recommend?
I don't agree with Matt's direction with releasing a ton of singles and then an album drop, though I think they're not on that path anymore. In today's music, Matt says the guitar is going obsolete which is true in a sense that the radio tends to feature more pop sounding songs. Their singles have guitar but it isn't as prominent as their past albums - Matt has been producing more electronic music, and I think it was Zedd who tweeted they collabed on a song. Wish he didn't follow the trend, but then again they always have a different sound each album. I'll always check it new Muse but the direction at the moment leaves a lot to be desired.	I mean, 3 isn't an awful lot

I have the stand version and the fan is barely audible. In a quiet bedroom at night, you’d hear it but unless you’re just being picky, it shouldn’t disturb you. Tho for overnight charging, I just use the cheaper 5w Anker stand that’s around $15 as overnight, speed is wasted anyway. I’ve also gotten out of the habit of overnight charging the majority of the time anyway. 	Hey thanks, I appreciate the feedback. The only time I charge my phone is overnight and it is also the only moment I would see wireless charging being feasible for me. Thanks again
They're usually a few bucks. IIRC they're not legal in comp, so they're not saught after.	Perfect thank you very much for your knowledge

Is that better than just bypassing the switch?  The hue bulb will come back on anyway, right?  If you're handy you can add a spring to a normal decora switch that keeps it in the on position, I have done it.	I may look into this, and it has already crossed my mind. To complicate matters, the circuit actually has two, three-way switches on it. Perhaps bypassing them all together is the answer.
I'm embarrassed for my city. 	What is Winnipeg like? Is there a lot of descrimination, crime, etc? I've never been, and in Oklahoma we don't even have cabs, so I don't have anything to compare this situation to. Is this a typical interaction?

That was awesome! Maybe edit the format in which you convey your words a little more? ex. We work, and work, and work, and bathe in denial. Collecting material objects that make us smile. Until we grow old, and become senile. And those once valuable objects just sit in a long-forgotten pile. Just my two cents, ive always enjoyed the free form writing poetry can have, and it makes it that much more impactful	That's a good idea. I might make a second draft in that style. Thanks.

So, I haven't been paying attention. Are people actually buying Fissure's explanation that iRemiix is just "better" in this meta? 	I hlgave them benefit of the doubt after the first match.

spending 6000 crystals on cards (never got a premium)	Glad I stopped at 3000 crystals.
Just a question for those who played in jp. Since Illya collab is coming, is the illya event hard to clear? Im quite nervous since i read that only female servants can join the event and i only have riders(martha, mary read and marie) as 4 stars, lvl 50 hassan( hundred persona), lvl 30-40 euryale and lvl 40 mash as playable chars.	Any servant can do the event, however only the female servants have the event bonuses. So you don't need to worry about that.
It says "gym hair" just the angle this photo was taken from	Does the angle really make all the difference though? I feel like that lettering is pretty deceiving at first look
I don't care if they won with it. That draft was pure azz. Lucky Flyquest inted them the win.	Comps like this are why C9 is in last place.  Reapered loves drafting comps that can't possibly win the game after 30 minutes.  No clue why.  C9's closeout problems have every bit as much to do with garbo drafts as garbo play, if not more.

Infinitode is a really in-depth and balanced endless TD. It's my personal go-to (aside from btd) for tower defense. It's free, light on storage, and while it isn't too flashy, it isn't hard to look at. There is tons of replay value as well, with the deep upgrade tree and various towers to unlock.

I hope they bring old school PB&amp;J for a week this year	Give them very basic things you have around the house like flour, milk, eggs.  Then they have to get creative to make good things. 
Just remember, for every you there is a me who gets a Furnace in their first Grift and has an excess of Ramaladni's Gifts sitting in their bank	I looted 7 yesterday in a 10h period

Is there any more news on this?  Do we know the next game yet?	nope.. they're currently working on prey multiplayer mode.
I’ve never tried on fried chicken Edit: just realized my English was off here lol Edit 2: thanks for gold lol	You life is sad bro
What am I looking at here?	The end of TFA (left side) and the start of TLJ (right side).
IANAL and you have already been given all the important information. But I just wanted to say, when I read the title I laughed so hard it made my side hurt. Not because your situation is funny but because joining the Army to avoid child support is not only wrong, but so wrong its insane. If any employer will make sure an employee is paying child support its the Military. 	Good to know that. I didn't know that before I posted this thread.
This is my favorite thing seen on the internet today.  Thank you.	It's got me wanting a gif of Brady nodding to a receiver in a huge moment calm and cool

Here is our question: What’s your best PC gaming memory growing up? It can be specifically about a game or even a system you were building or upgrading so you could improve the performance of a game you enjoyed playing or wanted to play. Also, we have a subReddit. Come and join us at r/ZOTAC. We are working on creating a community!  	Building my first computer with my dad. It worked like a charm.
I’m not a huge fan of any of those three. Plus I already preordered my Deluxe + from Square Enix	Same boat. I was going to just pre-order and return the copy to GameStop, but these designs aren't even worth the Hassel.
For future reference, if you dont have fast access to peroxide-press something hot against the bite. Not "brand yourself" hot but coffee mug hot. Hot tap water hot. Stops the itching. 	True, dis. Denatures a lot of those peptides and enzymes that make insect venom venomous. It's the  first line of treatment for any kind of aquatic stngs, like jellyfish.
I have actually looked this question up online and there are sites saying around 1 pm is the best time for a nap. Also keep in mind that a full sleep cycle takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes to be done. That's what I heard, but it could be wrong.	Yes, a full sleep cycle takes 1 1/2h, but it may vary plus minus 15 minutes by each individual and the time you need to sleep in isn't calculated yet. 
I gotta find a good brand ... I tried a couple over the weekend and just couldn’t do it. Not giving up, but not having much success yet either	Have you tried the 4505?

Wow, I see what you mean. While I would love a new game in the Chronos universe, unfortunately I think the similarities are probably due to a) the same artists working on both games and b) straight-up asset reuse. IIRC Oculus lets developers keep IP rights to their games and has actually been completely fine with developers reusing assets from Oculus Studios games in the past e.g. inXile agreed to make *The Mage's Tale* with the understanding that they could reuse assets in *The Bard's Tale 4*.	Yeah, look like Assett reuse, that I don't mind ... The real question is, will it support VR ?
It's either some kind of string with a lot of effects layered over it, or it's a vocoded screech. That's the only two things I can think of.	I mean, that sounds legit enough I suppose. Were those techniques viable back in the 70's? Because the noise sounds like something I've heard a dozen times before in classic disco tracks.
It's now called FSB to be precise.	Its actually both FSB and GRU
Will this update affect some of my current addons? This is my first pre patch and I use a good amount of addons 😭 + reshade 	Many add-ons will require an update to work with 8.0. Hopefully the authors of your favourite add-ons have been testing on the PTR and plan to make the required changes if any.

Overly convoluted with no search but still better than to whisper 50 people just to finish that one map on your atlas.	Just either put it on livesearch or look up a higher price, I do that for whenever I need a cheap trade. Paying 1c more is worth all the hassle and time invested.
Tbh he did get a lot better jeez. Not worth the win but if he actually practiced and improves (changes name too jeez) he might actually get a career in many years  	There's a better rapper already going to appear in cuts I Forget her name cause it's been awhile, but she wasn't as showy, rather she felt real.  Her style felt more personal and from her core, not a puff piece akin to glorifying themself
Comments disabled? I wish I could see those...spicy for sure. 	*acts shocked that comments are disabled*
650 gold per run ? That would be 6k5 for 10 runs and around 50mins, do you have any data on the amount you made through vendor the trash loots ? And also on how many bags you can get per run from the Potion of Treasure Finding ? Otherwise it really doesn't seem to be that much and I even doubt that it would get hotfixed, farming volatiles (though it requires a druid and a party) would be a lot more worth and is pretty reliable. The only good value I could imagine would be through the bags, and you'd need to get a lot of them to make it worth in my opinion	I was averaging 1.2k every run, including vendor trash and tiny treasure chests. Each run took me 3 min, so wasn’t that bad at all for raw gold. 
I never understood users that prefer the webmail access. Why am I even going through all the trouble that nothing has to be setup by the user? From a freshly installed PC it's literally just: Open Thunderbird / Outlokk	&gt; I never understood users that prefer the webmail access. You can't loose the emails when there's computer problems if the emails are never on the computer. 
I'd rather let prim be cleric or ophilia be merchant/dancer, than Cyrus be cleric. Every turn you have to heal with him is a wasted turn damagewise.	That’s a lot of spell damage. I have ophilia scholar, Olberic as an apoth, with therion as merchant and haanti as warrior. Olb tanks the hits and is single target healer, haanti is the damage, ophilia is dual dog and group heals with therion the support 
This is brilliant. Pattern??? 	I made it myself. 
Please everyone who is undecided vote Theros, it was such a flavorful set. Please guys. My favorite set ever. 2% difference. We are so close to greatness.	I mean I guess? But you could easily make the same as a counter argument.

Glad to hear that your mood is improving! I've been on Wellbutrin for a few years now. I found that I was nauseous for a little bit after taking it while I was adjusting, but hopefully your body will adjust. Are you taking it on an empty stomach? Eating something (or something extra) might help with the nausea. 	I am taking it with food it’s usually the second dose of the day that is the one that makes me nauseous! I find I am ok with the first morning dose but the afternoon one throws me off. I currently take 100mg Sr twice a day

I like them, just not with that shirt. I could pull those off since I'm about 6ft tall. But it's not as flattering on her since she's so short and squishy.	They need to be half as long for her frame. And maybe thinner strips. They look like mop heads.

If you don't have a name yet, I suggest "Midas' Lesson" To me it looks like she's beginning to understand the effect she has on other things, and that's a profoundly sad moment. The full realization hasn't hit yet, but the edges are coming through (again, to me).	Nice! That was the idea! 
Is it in a bathroom? Perhaps to hold a cane?	It really does look like it could hold a cane!  Makes sense to me.
I'm new to VR, anyone got recommendations for this sale? I'll probably get superhot but any other input is appreciated.	Skyrim VR is a consensus here for sure. Fallout 4 if you are into that setting. Sairento is a highly praised game as well. Definitely get super hot :) great game to introduce friends and such to VR. 
In order for Earth to have a capitol it would have to have some form of a centralized government. Otherwise there is really no way to come to a consensus on where such a capitol might be. Every nation would insist that their country was the best place simply due to the financial benefits. 	The UN is in New York.
Another good way to expand your collection without hurting your wallet too badly is to check out your public library. Most likely they'll have a streaming service or two that's free for patrons. My local public library has the entire Naxos catalogue streaming for example, and in good quality too.	&gt; public library. Most likely they'll have a streaming service I've never heard anything like this here in my country! However, I do not like streaming services Thanks anyway ;-)

People who hold X-nodes should not use exchanges to swap. If something happens to the exchange and it goes down past the snapshot period, you loose your x-node status. Wait for the token swap to open and do it yourself from the app!!!	Any info when I will be able to swap my tokens to VET on the wallet? I want to use exchanges as little as possible.
For your age category on the Concept 2 rankings your times are not that competitive - your 2k is your best: [https://log.concept2.com/rankings/2019/rower/500?age=19-29&amp;gender=M](https://log.concept2.com/rankings/2019/rower/500?age=19-29&amp;gender=M) 500m - 25th percentile (i.e. 75% of results are better) 1k - 50-75th percentile (i.e. 50-25% of results are better) 2k - Just over the 75th percentile (i.e. around 27% of results are better)	Okay thank you very much for this! Cannot believe how humbling this is but it’s perfect - exactly the kind of thing I need to know to improve :) cheers for the share!

!snapme	You are a child of Thanos. Your snap number is 68471.
I feel the most important reason to build a library on GOG is that if the apocalypse happens and steam is no longer a thing, who will own the games we bought on steam? With GOG, even if they go under we still own the games we bought. They can be played without the client. You can’t play steam games without signing in to steam. But if there’s no more steam, then what? What happens to our games if steam were to close up shop? In theory they’d be gone forever. 	Imagine Valve bankrupt. What would happen?
Well, Phillip Morris/Altria has their new pod system out too.  Was tempted to buy it since it’s super cheap at the moment on promotion. 	Which one is that?
I've had this happen when I lift weights. I concluded that I had a tendency to hold my breath. I began to focus on it - deep, regular breaths as I lift - and it never happened again. 	Thanks! I’ll try that today!
Wait, how is it that these pages are not archived? Didn't cha0s program mnemosyne at some point to archive everything in KIA's past? A different problem is that it no longer archives the threads a day after, to capture the 'discussion', as it did for a while. So we get an empty page/link with no discussion for whatever is archived.	the big problem is that archive.is or whatever can be taken down on a whim. I save most stuff I've seen for the past few years to PDF to avoid that and stealth edits.
Once you hit level 60, things even out and move chronologically. The horde fights Illidan, the Lich King, Deathwing, overthrows their bad leader Garrosh, stops an invasion from an alternate reality, fights an invasion from the Legion. The confusing part is that the expansion where you fight Deathwing, also redid the 1 to 60 leveling experience. So during that time period you just have to pretend you've already beaten Illidan and the Lich King in Outland and Northrend respectively. That and ignore all the weird phasing that happens because of it.	Thats not true. This picture is taken at level 110. And I have played out legion. So no it does not even out
I always recommend starting with V. And not the mobile version with the bad graphics. Find the GBA version somehow.	Seconding. FFV is a straight old school RPG and it's absolutely fantastic.

I really think they should have waited for Santa Cruz for this. Many people are going to have the "wait it requires a *gaming PC*?" moment with this...	SO many people, lol
And my favorite piece of hardware just keeps getting better.	I was contemplating getting the new DrumBrute as my drum machine but with all these consistent updates it looks like the Circuit may be the way to go. 
Carra and Simon played together no? I know Carras a pundit but I wouldnt want an old work colleague telling the world that my boss had just hired a much better me. Especially if i was as wholesome as Migs on insta. Thats gotta hurt a bit 	Don’t think they played together
I had no idea that Daric Barton was still playing. I also learned that he led the league in walks in 2010. 	Problem is that he also led the league in sacrifice bunts that year too. 
Are these guys still doing stuff?	I think the members are often busy in other bands. So maybe Off! are not that active all the time.
No idea, but I'll guess Alaska because I think I heard it had a ton of millionaires before....... *Post Look edit: nailed it.	I also guessed AK but not because of huge amounts of millionaires but because of really high paying oil jobs for relatively "average" folks. Skilled workers in a lucrative industry can make quite a good salary.
Wow, amazing difference!  You're Rockin it and you got this!  💪👊👏	Thank you. I finally feel in control of my life and it's a great feeling.

By default, screenshots on Steam are just on your harddrive until you share them. So if you can see the screenshot on steamcommunity.com, then you're good. Otherwise they will be lost if you wipe your harddrive.
"Are you almost done" when getting head. 	“Not anymore”

Onnit doesn't have anything you can't get better and cheaper elsewhere.	Use bacopa monnieri  instead of wasting money on alpha brain!
I know this is an unpopular opinion.  But, I will still watch even if Palin is on the show.  I am very liberal so I find right wing people really foreign.  I think it would be interesting to see a close up look at how the other side lives. 	Same here! Its fascinating to see how polar opposite someone can feel on other issues. 
I would recommend a CRM system for you office...  we use and recommend Zoho CRM	Thanks! I will give it a try on monday 
I know I probably have about 200 comments saying this but you can't do a job you don't enjoy. If being at a front desk of a hotel is awful for you but you enjoy bartending, please just go and work at a bar for your career. Considering running one! Maybe the job prospect of your career isn't what you want. Consider if you want to continue your study if you're not interested in it. If you do want to get your degree, 3 months isn't all that much. You'll get used to the monotony and perhaps find something to do when you are bored. 	Thanks I appreciate it. I mean this degree also helps with the whole bar thing. So I’m really trying to stick with it.
Now I gotta watch YGS 100 again	Yo mamma's so fat she couldn't was was a Big Mac!

Devlin Pennine from UKKeyCaps. 	&gt;Devlin Pennine from UKKeyCaps I like the green and blue, Thanks, I will keep that in mind. It will cost a bit more to get the add on set as well. 
Whatever happened to calling mixed-breed animals mongrels? Admittedly it's not as catchy as liger or jaglion (or cockapoos, cockerd oodles etc) . But... yknow we do already have a word for it. 	I believe that a mongrel is a mixed animal of unknown ancestery. A Jaglion or Liger, is determined by the father's breed first and then the mothers. So a Jaglion would be a male Jaguar and a female lion. If it were reversed it would be a Liguar

Awesome, I did that ride a few years ago on Memorial Day weekend. Buddy and I were riding in the area, figured we’d be able to at least go partway up before the road closed but lo and behold it was open all the way to the (still snowy) summit! I definitely recommend this ride to anyone.	You rode up there with snow on the ground? Awesome. I'd have turned around at the first sign of snow on that road, especially in those spots where there looks like nothing but empty sky off the side with no guardrails
Well you could "hire" a friend to fly you around :) Whenever someone's level in my group hits a "Schnappszahl" (all digits identical) we kinda RP being his/her assistants/drivers/pilots in a theme of the Boss' chosing. It usually ends up being a trip to the Unicorn and the Yacht, but at least it gives us reasons to use the odd vehicles, outfits and complimentary champagne for once. Edit: clarification	This is really cool and I'm jealous of your guys' togetherness

To really get into football, you need a club that gives you glory and misery equally. So no Real Madrid, Manchester United, Barcelona, PSG, Juventus, etc. I recommend Galatasaray from my hometown İstanbul. We are usually good in the league, we are sometimes great in Europe but mostly we just suffer. It is a good combination. 	Glory and misery equally? Now why didn't you tell me that...

There was an ice golem Nita skin idea before. It made Nita and her bear blue and that's all. You it's the same but more detailed and realistic and looks like something in the game. 	 it's the details that make the difference 
Good build but i would get another 8gb ram and eelace the motherboard with a z370 one for overclocking. Oh and get a cooler	You want him to get 24gb? That's pretty weird
And 6 command dials instead of 3, and 2 spare cardboard base plates, is this just so one can convert another pre-owned ISD to chimaera?	Correct. Idea was to allow you to convert 2 other ISDs to the new forms as well. Extra dials are for Thrawn's command card.
I love it. If I could give some critiques, it would be that there seems to be light reflecting on the lips and leaves but not in the eyes, where it’s the most common to see a “sparkle”. I suggest using the dodge tool or the eraser tool on a low opacity. This way it won’t be too harsh because the rest of the portrait is soft. Well done !	Thank you very much! I always have trouble deciding where to place the highlights sometimes specially if I'm not sure where the light source is coming from. I will definitely take this into consideration with my next painting. :)
If someone’s shoes are worn out, it could also mean that they run/walk a lot, which would usually mean they’re the opposite of fat.

A win is a win, and a 6-0 win is pretty pleasing Apparently McGeouch was really good, and so was Maguire	Gooch also looked very sharp, will be a big player for us this year
The game is good too but I feel the UI isn't as snappy and responsive than Hearthstone's.	I just wish there was a way to tell if it is my turn or my opponent's turn.

I successfully stole my classmate's prized toy cars when I was in kindergarden because they looked pretty cool. I snatched the cars away when he wasn't looking and hid it in my bag's deepest pocket. When he eventually realized that his cars were missing, he checked everywhere and asked everyone to find it, I participated in that search. I also lied in front of his and the teacher's face that I hadn't seen it.  He couldn't find it and eventually after school I saw his parents comforting him and saying he can just buy other ones. At first, it was pretty exciting but seeing him after school with his parents made me feel like an absolute POS (and I still do). What's worse is that I didn't find them that fun and eventually threw them away. 	did you ever tell him?

Your website [http://www.eleganttools.info/shop/product-category/money-spell/](http://www.eleganttools.info/shop/product-category/money-spell/) also looks like it dabbles in witchcraft-related items and spells.  I can't get along with that.	I knew something felt off about this. All the comments are nice and welcoming(which is awesome btw), but I kept looking for someone to say "hmm, this has a weird vibe".
I sat directly behind Momoa's kids in Hall H yesterday for his Aquaman panel. They seemed so genuinely excited to see their dad on stage and to see the trailer. It was so incredibly adorable.	Pratt and Ruffalo can’t relate
How does that ring give pleasure? Sorry am not familiar with it. 	I think it goes around “it” and makes it hard. 
To address this bias I have valiantly [approved everything.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/285281772810403840/470652914168233984/unknown.png)	I'm proud of you for showing that even the most entrenched demagogues can turn things around and be good people again. Thank you for doing better. Thank you for being better.
That is poorly worded	Yes would've flown much better if it was worded differently 
You want some money? 	I could use about tree fiddy 
I'm level 105 and I still haven't even touched the Powers tree... I'm a long ways off from unlocking all my monkey knowledge.	Same here. I was more talkative by about tower upgrades
lol why cant we just have an igm philosopher's poll to solve philosophy for good like they did economics	Political scientist poll would also be neat
Misspelled Snips	In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you're under arrest
The Sacred Grove is an amazing place.  I felt so much peace there.  It's almost like a temple.	I have never gone. For some reason no one will tell me where it is :(
He gets some major development in the Buu saga. I didn't like Vegeta too much from the saiyan- cell arcs, but he becomes more likeable from the Buu saga onwards. He still takes major L's, but I would argue he becomes more useful overall in Super. .	He becomes a fully fledged deuteragonist in Super,
When's Dante's Inferno but with Kratos	You mean that segment of every GoW game where Kratos falls into and climbs out of Hades?
I'm in my mid-20s, but I've been having symptoms at least since when I was 17.  It's definitely not just aging.	Yeah, OP's friend is completely wrong. 
Is the host lady related to mother Chantall? 	No, but she did go to the Barbizon School for Hosting...
What kind of shoes are you looking for? I am wearing my cowboy boots 	Love cowboy boots! I'll probably go with a lower heel or a wedge. I was thinking blush-colored because I have a pink ribbon around my waist. I also love glitter or velvet. There are just so many choices.
Has anyone called him Gabewad yet?	Well she’s gonna be screaming it tonight.
A low-key argument for QB wins. When Eli plays great, the team wins the Super Bowl. When Eli plays poorly, the team is doomed.	Wasn't Eli widley considered the only Giant who played well in their recent loss?
Looks stoned	he loves grass
I’ve always wondered what was the dragon made out of. Chakra? Or the red vapor??	Guy's Blood. That vapor is his blood.
Um, what happened to the bus only lane on Rhode Island Ave NE?  Seems like business as usual this AM.	Some info in this [post](https://ggwash.org/view/68446/little-enforcement-on-the-temporary-bus-only-lane-installed-to-ease-red-line-shutdowns). 
I won a lifetime supply of **coffee beans** in a contest. Each month they mail 4 lbs. of excellent quality coffee beans of my choice. Sometimes I give them away as gifts as I can't use them all.	That is amazing. I miss drinking coffee so bad. :( 
I wonder if the guy in the picture is taking the picture. 	I kind of hope not
I don’t trust anyone in this game, so i can’t trust this	I can guarantee that this will work. I tried it on my sloop, my friend's slop, and then again on another occurrence when I found another chest of sorrow. It will work
Lot of gaming hardware comes with the ability to program a series of actions into one button click. That's all it is, just makes it virtually instant in armlet toggling or selecting meepos and poofing.	oh so like instead of selecting meepos with alt+1/2/3/4 it just scrolls through them instantly?
You have 9 already	Wow. I just realized that now. Thanks
Ew no, don't make me look at my water grid	Yeah, built 5\* Uno and I still think it might be my worst team...
14 man ppr. Without knowing team needs and lineups would you do either of these trades? Give- Melvin Get- godwin, Chubb, late 2019 first  Or Give- kamara, 2019 2nd Get- cooks, Chubb, tawayn Taylor My team does have a pretty stacked lineup but my bench players are rough and probably not startable	I'd pass on both trades
Why would these former employees have any clearance beyond that of an average citizen?	That's just how clearnaces work. You keep the clearances after you leave the job for some reason. That's how veterans usually find work, because they're about the only people out there who can be hired for clearance work and already have the clearance.
Are we trying to get the game earlier or patch notes earlier? Lol	Yes
It's your fault firstly for supporting this kind of behavior from companies, never pre-order, even if you are going to cancel it later.	Yea, I do agree with you, I normally don't get preorders.  
Honestly if you have high stats and weak ecs the decision probably depends on your essay! I go to UCLA now and i remember thinking wow I don't know how I am going to make myself sound special and struggling with my essays.  If you want someone to look at your essay email me [kimy97@g.ucla.edu](mailto:kimy97@g.ucla.edu) 	Bit late to the party but if you could PM me your essays that would be great!
What is happening? Is Angela bonding with Kaitlin right now?! 😮😂	Kaitlyn is not a threat to win, but she is not someone I'd want to see on the block against either.
The cult summoned a demon. And now it's after *them*.	They have chosen the name of the destructor.
'Trumps top economic adviser' is a euphemism for 'some guy'	Could also be a gal, unfortunately it won't ever be a euphemism for 'someone competent'.
Feel ya, we usually don't think of it as promoting "smaller" people though. We love doing the Bonuses over regular episodes with certain guests, because they lend themselves to uninterrupted and relaxed conversations way more, since there's no ads. Wasn't out of disrespect to him or you guys.	No disrespect felt, and i see your point and definitely agree that he was a definitely good choice for an uninterrupted ep.
I like Casino more than goodfellas, sue me	Subpoena is in the mail and I will see you in court good sir 
Didn’t realize Carlton stole his signature dance from our Lord and Savior... 	Now the lyrics make sense. It's not unusual to be loved by any One.
Man, that keyboard must be Heaven to type on!	I haven't done much more than getting through the time and date setup, but once I clean it up and get a new HDD/CF adapter and a DOS 5.0 floppy I plan to do some serious typing on it.
She wasnt the love of your life. The love of your life is still searching for you.	Realizing this really helped me get through my last breakup with the woman I wanted to marry.
11:05 no NEXT :(	May take awhile for the update to.be rolled out.  Give it a bit.
INB4 300 comments of "harassing somebody is obviously wrong... *but...*"	AKA OP two posts down. 
Nice work! You look great!	Thank you!
Absolutely no correlation. Plus this is my fourth pregnancy and I had zero morning sickness with 2 of them, just a tiny bit early on with 1 and hg with 1 so there's not even a correlation between them.	As a ftm who had severe HG for 12 weeks you give me hope. 
Let her know that it would be good for you her and everybody if she tended to her own needs. Sometimes for a 2 you May have to trick them to take care of themselves by referencing the other that they put so much into 	Thanks, that means a lot coming from actual 2.
I design and sell items used in virtual communities.  I just whip it up in Blender, and go to a marketplace on Second Life, or InWorlds, or a few other online virtual places and sell them.  I don't make tons of money (though some people do) but I make enough to buy myself some toys every once in a while.  A new guitar, new computer, a gamestation, yadda yadda.  	Would a modeling program like SolidWorks work for this too? I've made some decent looking stuff in SW before. ~~Is there a website that you can sell the models on?~~ Just saw the answer to this in another comment.
Despite him saying he will do a birthday stream (said that before this lucy drama happened) I doubt he will do one now. It would be a shitshow, on his birthday. Doubt he will want to do that. Will proabably tweet he is taking the night off to enjoy his final birthday hours. If he DOES do it, chat will be filled will questions, and he will be scrambling to answer them and shrug them off, or just do a pure game stream like last time where he just played WoW constantly and didnt talk about his life at all. I expect all his streams from now on, to be radio silent on his life, and will just be his fat face playing games all night and only stopping to read off his subs and thank the kids for taking their lunch money so he can get fatter.	If he does a stream and says anything of note I hope someone archives it in case he deletes the VOD
&gt; Japan-Germany symposium The last one they had didn't end well	hopefully this one will turn out alreich
i dont watch for the lore primarily and honestly that isnt what the show is geared toward really it would lose alot of identity of the predecessor 	Hey, TheCrystalJewels, just a quick heads-up: **alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**. Have a nice day! ^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment.
Just finished a 10.2-mile run. I was planning another 3 miles, but my legs decided it was time to quit. So I had to do a 1-mile walk-of-shame back home alongside a busy road :(	I burned ~1200-1900 calories (depending on if Strava with a heart rate monitor is to be believed). This means I can eat a bucket of fried chicken, right? Right?
It's a better return but not mindblowing. The Mets retaining none of Familia's salary is worse. 	Wait, what?
I think an E damage nerf with increased damage to jungle monsters along with a buff to W damage would be better. Bc fiddle would miss having the damage on E against some camps	Allow E to bounce off himself if first target was a large monster
Wait is that chocola?	No it's a karate girl
Did anyone else notice the sound of the pumps kicking in just be for ignition?	Wow, I just went back and heard it. That sounds so cool!
Hahahaha, brilliant! xD	What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow ?
How much did they need to pay the guy driving the truck?	I think the going rate is 72 virgins
These are the QC  vids Peltiano has sent me ... Front - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAEywS7ZfwQ Back - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SgdxwV12lc&amp;feature=youtu.be he advised the neck tags will be added before shipping and he is going to send out pictures when its done .	That looks pretty good. Fabric seems thick as retail
Ending scene in Silent Voice 	Not just the ending scene, honestly.
I heard the power up by Duffy's is back, but I talked to Janet and she said her power's not back yet :-/	Well maybe if Janet would unplug those Christmas lights her power would be on. I know that they aren't turned on, but I'm telling you they draw power even if they are just plugged in.
You really should link the original thread but that is a fantastic rendition of poor Barnaby.	It took me a sec to copy over the links. OP was nice enough to let me share. The original thread is full of goodies.
A bit of dry ice there would have gone a long way in improving the presentation	Maybe some disco lights too. 
Sick collection man! Where to buy the poster? it looks cool.	The name of the artist is [Kehasuk](https://www.kehasuk.com/). He only does a sale online 4 times a year. Next day is August 1st. 
What time?	First thirty seconds
I bought STW just a couple of days ago before the release of the skins. I’m addicted to it now. I rarely play BR now.	Same situation for me
Wow, that child couldn't catch that toss? DFA them immediately.	That's Teo's kid
My friend and I were camping in Big Sur and thought it was a giant meteor breaking up in the atmosphere. 	funny enough it ended up being something leaving the atmosphere, not entering it! 
* Sonarr * Radarr * Plex * OpenVPN * DDNS In no particular order. 	What is Sonarr?  I checked the website and read the FAQ and I'm still not sure.  Something like sickbeard to make torrenting easier? radarr has even less information on what it does.
Why is this thread so huge? It honestly seems bizarre to me that we're all so invested in a change in one person on the social media team. Like, there's 136 comments on this thread and about 24 on the one about how the team hired a bunch of new scouts and promoted a key person in the organization. 	It's July. Why are any of us posting on here at all? I don't want to wish the summer away... but I'd sure like to watch some hockey.
I don't get much vapor at ~380 degree Temps for the first few pulls, you'll definitely get effects though it's just invisible vapor at first. 	If you really want to see clouds get a water pipe adapter and run the CFX at 430 degrees. But be warned this will send you to the moon haha
Tfw you'll never get your neck licked by Rize-san	[Feels bad](https://mobile.twitter.com/sotonami/status/592404488557760512)

The great r/adelaidefc schism that resulted in us now having two subreddits... 	&gt;The great r/adelaidefc ~~schism~~ expansion
We will never know if it was sheer luck, or that he was really counting the timer of Brewmaster's ult.	could have been a bit of both tbh - not exactly counting it but he probably has an internal clock better than ours at counting that type of stuff subconsciously then just hooked when it felt right.
They don't. They absolutely could unlock another car of the same model. I believe Nissan has gone on record to say that they have something like only 3,000 (might've been 30,000) unique key configurations. So odds are you could find another car you could unlock. But unlocking a car is all you could do, since many car keys nowadays make use of transponders to prevent someone else's key from starting the engine.	My dad had a Nissan truck in the late 90's &amp; we could unlock pretty much every single other Nissan truck of the same model, they never started, but we never once found one we couldn't unlock.
Came through here before. Assumes no gloves or very short gloves, and is a big risk of wrist fracture in a crash.	Just appreciate a nifty idea without tearing it apart. Keep the good vibes up

You should've sent me a WUPHF.	WUPHF was my idea.  I think I'm going to sue you.
“Every professor and prominent intellectual?” 🤔	Able to corroborate Source: am every professor and intellectual.
For me tolerance takes a long time.  Also the more food I eat in the day or night before affects the strength of kratom.	less food makes it hit harder or less?
Congratulations! Looks like a great find 	Thank you! I’m real excited to drive it! 
Kicking myself so hard for not buying more before the swap...oh well I guess I'll hopefully see some green soon if we can hit $.0485	I want to go in for more, but now the question is will the "pullback" price be higher than where it is right now?
Hut take: People who own reptiles larger than a microwave are lunatics and can't be trusted. 	Why is the microwave your unit of measurement?

Why is your smile this }	He's trying to include information that isn't important, such as that nose.
You don’t know true power until you run Stevens DB with Sawed Off	This loadout is even more powerful with slugs equipped on both of the Db and sawed off
LPT: Put a paper towel in with your Costco sized spinach to make it last literally another 1 to 2 weeks. Huge saver for me. 	I do this with all my fresh fruit and veggies. It really does make a difference. Now, if you'll pardon me, I do believe I have some limp dill that needs to be put in the freezer, at the suggestion of a kind Redditor.
Never heard anyone that spells doodle as doddle. Good drawing tho	Ahhhhh I just noticed! It was late in my country and I was sleepy! (Yes, this is totally a solid excuse)
This making me realize it’s going to take ages to crown someone can’t wait for round 1000	We have a long off season. Also it seems like it will gradually be revealed like 100-90 then few more quizzes here’s 90-80 more quizzes 80-70 etc
0 Resprings so far with mitshuaXI.	I have MitsuhaXI and Artsy installed and have no random resprings
Same here. But not just the event, other reputation projects as well. It worked for a moment when I went somewhere else (sorry I don't remember) but when I changed captains it happened again.	It’s possible the marks are being dumped into overflow, check your inventory and see if your inventory is full and if not then check the overflow bag.
I know it doesn't help, but im having the same issue	I'm having the same issue also. Edit - Made the second choice (my charisma was high enough) and hit Skip and it got me through.
Even yugioh has its mecha bunny that summon itself two times. It is a pretty common thing in the pop culture	Yes but are they on a Pogo stick ? 
Going to be downvoted for this, but the Myers/Briggs personality test has been highly discredited and isn't a meaningful indicator of personality types.	It is a meaningful indicator of Personality types. I wouldn’t recommend using it to hire someone, or choose a significant other, or really to make any decisions in your life, but it is a proven model in 3 main categories. Look it up.  
I'm in Milan the week of the derby. Inter are the home team, but I prefer Milan, so I would rather sit in the Milan end. How easy is it going to be to get tickets?	Not easy
Serious talk: You should've left at least a couple for other emergencies. You never know when you'll need em.	Or that the first couple of days could be rough before patches are made. 
Expecting a full send on this continued bull run after futures contracts end later today. 	Futures volume is pathetic compared to average daily volume of Bitcoin. When will people realize futures expirations have very little affect on BTC price?!

As a goalie I can't figure out how to change my catching clove . It's on the right hand. I want it on left.but can't find it. Any one know? Thanks. 	Where you set your load out. You can change type of goalie, height, weight and hand
To everyone who thinks this is wrong, let’s try a different proof. 3 * 1/3 = 1 (no one argues this) But if we put this in decimal form, 3 * 0.333.. = 0.999.. See it now?	9x is the problem i see
So, is she being groomed for 2020? She seems to be showing up constantly in headlines, for almost everything she does. Further, her endorsement seems to be kicking up funding for other progressive dems, and she's been partnering with Sanders for that purpose. Just makes me wonder if there's a reason every thing she does is generating news. This isn't a criticism of her or her policies. There's literally like 2-3 headlines mentioning her between top and new right now.	Democrat leadership is non-existent is why. People clamor for responses to what bother them, and people will fill that gap increasingly until the Democratic Party is a non-entity.
LOL, wife's reaction was the best part. 	The husband’s reaction to the wife’s reaction.
Well, you rock them!!	thank you!
The sound effect from the sunlight damage made it even better.	***Is there something I can do for you?***

Dwayne Johnnson	I don't think you can call him washed up, if he is starring in every top blockbuster and getting great reviews. he in like 3 movies a year. 
eating sashimi (if you enjoy raw fish), or naruto style (wrapped in cucumber &amp; seaweed) are the most keto friendly. I'm still finding a perfect cauliflower rice cooking method that can act as a rice substitute for sushi rolls (last few we've made have fallen apart)	oooooh I was thinking about that the other night when i was making cauli rice- be sure to let us know if you figure something out :o
Fortunately for you, it’s gotten a lot easier. Since 5.1, SSD progression in canny twine is unbounded to your quest progression. In order to enter twine, you can simple do the following: 1. Finish SSD 1, then directly to 2,3,4,5,6. (Yes you can do that now.) 2. Do the rocket off mission in Canny pl70 3. Welcome to twine peak	Does it work for going from plank to canny? 
I have lime spiralis and pink troikas (and scorer pink reapers, which I like but could move)	i like the lime spiralis, just wanna see what else gets offered for little longer
Depends on what you mean by rude.  If they are threatening, get a manager.  If it's something like sexism or racism or homophobia, get a manager.  You aren't expected to deal with that sort of stuff.  But if it's just basic rude, just gotta do it with a smile on your face.	A girl I work with told me she got so many sexist remarks today, so I told her she shouldn’t have to deal with that while working or otherwise. I was so mad when she told me. I’ll let her know to get a manager next time.
Man I feel bad for PMG. Imagining him in my scenario with PK doing targeted harassment is terrible. I don't think anybody harassed him or anything but the idea of someone doing that is sickening	PK has been parading around PMG's comment about the state of /r/neoliberal (a great comment to be clear) Pretty sick if you ask me, using an emotional post from a teen about his favorite community to score points on CTH
Bad link. 	[is this better?](https://m.imgur.com/a/ekhMkwQ) It has a bunch of views so I dunno why it's not working for you :-/
I don’t know these gold pieces well enough to be sure, but I feel like there are 100x more fakes out there than real ones. So I’d be suspicious. You’ll probably have to figure out the weight it should be and check it with a good scale.	Agreed. This one looks _less fake_ than many others I've seen, but proceed with caution...

I hit the gym, all chest no legs	Then I make myself a smoothie
Nice, but wouldn't it make sense to write the languages in their own language? I.e. English/Deutsch/Francais/Español?	Jupp, you're right. This would be much better. I will fix that in the next release. Thanks for the hint.
Is there any reason to keep quick repair contract?i used them a lot today (like 30ish at 3-4N)	Later on in mid game, you will get a lot. I am currently close to 1.8k quick repair after a year play time. By leveling up your echelon, you will find lesser and lesser repair needed. 
Last year I realized my tickets had been sent to the wrong address. I showed up Wednesday night and they were able to sort everything for me no problem. I wouldn't worry too much. Definitely go to will call as soon as you can though, Wednesday night at 10 pm had no lines, can't say the same for Thursday at 9am.	Kinda related question: Do you know how late Will Call is open on Friday? Never used WC before this year. I already emailed GC customer service, but you seem knowledgeable.
This is my new favorite picture of all time. 	Haha nice

&gt;I'm just wondering is it possible to have more inkflow using the back of the nib. Not unless the back surface of the tines is ground to give a better writing surface.  Alternatively, you can increase flow by widening the tines but this will make normal pen use wetter too. Your best bet is  just to get a second pen with a finer nib.	&gt; Not unless the back surface of the tines is ground to give a better writing surface. Usually the assumption "the more expensive the nib the better it is at reverse writing" holds true.

Best of luck, hope you don't need to use your spray	I always pray I don't have to and the thing is I've been running there almost a year now and I haven't begun overthinking it until now because I know how people see dogs.
NEXT!	Hue hue hue I wonder how she's keeping lately. 
Was that a girl or a dude he was hitting? Edit: i mean a trans woman because she seemed really large and muscular for a woman. I wasn't saying she was ugly.	I believe it was a trans woman.
I think you can still see other people, but I'm not sure. I warped back to a friend home system (which i had discovered joining in his game once) while playing 'sp' without telling him and I could still see his icon moving around. Didnt get close enough to him to see if he rendered or anything so honestly I'm not sure at all. :') Would love to know that too tho.	You see a little orb floating around is all
40-100GB for 2160p Remux 8-20GB for less desirable quality 2160p I’ve been replacing my less desirable 4K movies with Remux versions. If you have a home theater and a nice 4K TV, there’s a difference.  	Would a 20gb 4K release look better on a 1080p screen? 
This is the quality OC that I sub for tbh.	The technical term is "shitpost"
R	A
I'm really liking the sound of this! Hopefully it's not too long until it's released.	Yeah, I’m hoping they really speed up the process here although I’m unsure of the drama between her and her label r.e her sound cloud/ whether that is a dispute with current management 
"Summoned creatures (Zagara Roaches, Azmodan Demons, etc.) now deal ability damage which can be enhanced by the Hero’s Ability Power." I thought this was already the case for characters like Nazeebo?	This is quite a Jaina buff
Reckon he’s feeling insecure about the trim lol hide with a hat 	Or by the look of that tan and palm trees he's somewhere very sunny and warm so is wearing a hat.
Game and watch.	Nope. Just watch!
Short answer: Yes. Long answer: where. How much. How big. What type. Price range. Companies in your area you can call. 	I’ve been trying to find companies in my area (south Florida) that do this kind of thing, but I haven’t had any luck. A 30 gallon long is the size i want, and i haven’t completely decided on a price range yet.

Would you be happier doing stuff before work during the day or after at night?	Well I would like to do stuff after word preferably. I feel to pressed for time before work 
Pay is currently £8 an hour for over 18s not sure about Under 18s, but by September it'll be £9.20 an hour for everyone even under 18s Currently work there 	Sounds great, how would you say the work is there?
BA is the safest pick; nothing else can really come close to that deck's longevity. Depending on the upcoming imports from Link Pack Vrains, Burning Abyss could become even better, and Aromage might actually be semi-competitive for once. Pendulum Magicians are also a good pick; still seeing results, are probably not going to be knocked down even further, and after the mega tins all the expensive extra decks cards will fall in price (which means you can mess around with the main deck and a budget extra deck and see how you like it).	What about altergeist?
also can buy the keybar 	offer
Pls no. Red Sox have no prospects to give.	Implying we would need to give up serious prospects for Beltre...
I've heard that multiple times but I it never stuck, plus I need the temp in Fahrenheit	Honestly, why doesn't the US switch? They are *literally* the only ones who don't use the metric system
Is there any other anime that uses this much camera movement other than maybe Fate?	Not enough in budget I’d imagine 
This legit shamed me into wiping and leaving the toilet 	Likewise
Under the Influence by Eminem?	No, but thank you for introducing me to this song.
THAT’s the save of the match?????	It was a tough choice
It’s very impressive as well 	The char head is built from scratch 
I have a question regarding this topic: When someone said this song is written in the key of G, for example, then all the chords in the song have to be in key of G, is that right?	Not at all. Borrowing chords from other keys and using notes outside the scale for color or surprise are extremely common.
notification squad, where you at?	You rang?
I think  all those challenges are really meant to thin out the herd. 	Is there a sub for all of these idiotic challenges? There MUST be at least one!
Congratulations you've survived the aquarium interrogation and answered all our questions to satisfaction. You are allowed to have a piano fish tank.	Right!? Bahahhahaa!

Today you're old if you still type "www" most people don't bother	Strictly speaking www.whatever.tld is different to whatever.tld. It's just that servers generally forward the latter to the former. They *could* be two different websites.
Good old Tom Collins.	Not enough bars serve these 
Are the Qultists actually betting on something happening today? It's going to be a lot less satsifying if no one melts down.	It's the last day of July when Q said the world would finally discover the truth and Q is two posts away from post number 1776 which all the Qultists are sure is going to be the MOAB
I need an endless version	Agreed
Choker collars and leather wrist bands.	Chokers/collars are still pretty popular
Dark and Stormy. Gosling’s Rum crucial. Ginger Beer and lime wedge. 	And it needs to be goslings. I've had better rum but there's something about how syrupy goslings is that works.
Awesome!	Thanks for the support! SalSaatchi
Good pull. I kind of thought he was headed our way. Heck of a prospect.	I don't think this one is quite over...
In other words, “I’m about to get busted for leaking classified information to the press so I need to act like I’m running for office to make it look like a political hit job when the feds show up at my door and arrest me.” 	hadn't actually thought of this angle.
Ended the spring with 151 million. Now I have four guys from Columbus to try and fit in a decent first string midfield.	I can't remember the last time I couldn't afford a guy I wanted.
Would you take a few crates/Painted toppers for those peppermint wheels?	I'd only pass because I don't use toppers and won't open the crates. You wouldn't happen to have maybe a non crate very rare or want to pair the wheels up with something else for a key?
In addition to a ton of other Marian Hill stuff (her new album Unusual should be pretty enjoyable if you like the sounds in "Down") I think you may like SATICA. Her song Honey Whiskey has a similar "contrast" between the verse and chorus.  She's a little less intense than Marian Hill but writes some great songs, definitely worth checking!	You're aware Marian Hill is 2 people, right? And neither one of them is named Marian Hill...
Danny Burito?	Someone once called him 'Zoney DeVito', and frankly, it still impresses me to this day
there are no rules in your mums bedroom tho. and yes i am that bored	wow thanks for a bit of truely SP humour at least somebody commented..:D
I suppose it's difficult to do a deal if the deal involves exchanging a player who's unwilling to be exchanged. What can you do? 	Everyone shouting shambles and everything, but yeah, what can you do? Gayle is well within his right to refuse a move. Can't blame NUFC here.
The last time it was mentioned was on a CAD referring to the last remaining ships in need of a rework (Redeemer, Merlin, M50, 85x) and was stated that they would look into reworking the ships towards the end of year since they need to be updated to the Item 2.0 systems. I was saying before to expect them to appear in the 3.5-3.7 patches but seeing as so much stuff got pushed out of 2018, it may be awhile before they bother with them.	Maybe in 2019... Maybe.  Just like S42 release.
I am fairly certain that you don't even need to wear the armor. The only thing the armor is required for is the elemental orbs. My fireteam and I took off all of the armor to do the patrols and heroic public events. It all counted. The armor descriptions don't mention wearing the armor for anything other than elemental orbs.	Thanks, friend. Added an edit for you. 
Lookin for feedback on this beat I'm working on! Any feedback is very appreciated and will be returned ;) Also who can you hear going on this beat? [**https://soundcloud.com/kboxxbeats/fog/s-z2l5C**](https://soundcloud.com/kboxxbeats/fog/s-z2l5C)	Tbh. I cant really hear anyone on this. The melodies are out of key.

I’m not having fun with it for the first time since I l started playing in season one. So I’m taking a break at the moment hoping for change 	Thinking the same. 
Don't be too open to finding a guide. There are an awful lot of shady people out there all too happy to "mentor" you.	Yeah I figured, that’s why I posted this hoping for some advice on what to look out for 
Yeah it's on the knockout list too though so if you want the piece for each armor slot you just buy it 5 times. They act like ornaments so once you unlock say gloves it becomes unlocked for the gloves on each character. They are not used like shaders.	I just seem to never get enough bright dust.  At least I got the leg Chroma.... 
I still have both personal hotspot and vpn on my main page. What happens when you 3D Touch the quick settings in control centre, can you enable the hotspot from there or has it disappeared from there too?	It’s blanked out. Worked before the beta https://i.imgur.com/G8kpALw.jpg

As far as how much younger I just use the divide by 2, round up, then add 7 rule so right now 16 is as low as I can go. As far as older I have no clue.	And how old are you if I may ask

I feel like I totally would have given this game a try if it was f2p, but I think $20+ is too much for something I really might not like. I'll probably check it out when it goes on sale for dirt cheap one day.	You've got a good point there.
Got an extra dab for me? Haha	Anytime!

No Starbucks, no deal. I don't even go there, but it lets me know I'm in civilization.	There’s a Starbucks there now. This picture is probably from the 90s. It somehow looks exactly the same, but totally different. It’s the weirdest place.

It's completely unsurprising that teenagers, many of whom are unlikely to have ever even had a job at all leading up to their professional LoL career, wouldn't have the foresight to double check their contracts. 	I've reviewed some professional league contracts - they really need to be reviewed by an attorney, not just the player/coach.
I love this story. Thank you	Thanks! I'm struggling with motivation for a lot of things right now, but knowing there are people who enjoy what I'm doing makes it a bit easier to get myself in the mood to do some writing. So yeah, genuinely, thank you!

They're the generation that was born into one of the best economies in U.S history and turned it into one of the worst. It's maddening when one of them tells me to "just buy a house already."	Worst economy? When poor people now have more comfort items than the middle class had back then, i wouldn't call it the worst. We are living in the fullest, richest point ever to be experienced in human history.

Not exactly what you’re looking for, but Hue sells a really nice wireless switch.  You could pull out the current physical switch, connect the wires on the inside, then just put a blank cover over the box and stick the Hue switch overtop if it.

This looks like a Rage Against the Machine album cover.	I smell a top post on r/fakealbumcovers coming soon.
At the end of the day it's up to you, but we're talking about $46 here. And sorry but it's not a "mistake" to miss some debris at visit 1. I know you think it is, but it's not. And telling the doc where it hurts does not make it easier to find the debris. The eye is notoriously bad at pain location. It can "feel like" it's somewhere and actually be located in a totally different place. In fact that may be one of the reasons the extra debris was "missed" the first time. I'm sure I'll get labeled a troll again but you really weren't as wronged as you think you were. There - the bad boy of r/optometry has put in his $0.02 😃	Don’t listen to this troll. Every eye doctor has foreign body-seeking biomicroscopy equipment. Like X-ray vision but for sand and stuff.

Forget Space Force, let's get true Navy Seals. No country can withstand an army of cute baby seals. Edit: close to 200 of you people are absolutely mean. Promoting animal violence and stuff.

While there are a lot of negatives surrounding this card, it’s created a ton of free press for wotc. Maybe it did exactly what they wanted. How many people are *really* going to stop playing because they can afford a play set of a card? 	I don't think the "free advertising" idea holds up in this case. The only people who are hearing about this are already deeply into Magic.

So, in order to balance this a bit more, I made [this card](https://i.imgur.com/5IQe397_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium) to be the way you would get the spells. Let me know which version you think it's better: Being stand alone spells or only obtainable through the minion above.	Standalone spells. They are too slow with a minion that shuffles them into you deck. Maybe if it was into hand then it would be okay on a minion. Most of the spells aren't really too strong, assuming some wording is fixed.

On the contrary, there are things on the   smaller end of the spectrum of the same order of magnitude.  So we're massive compared to those.	Are they the *same* order of magnitude though? I thought we were *a lot* closer to the size of subatomic particles than the size of the universe.

I go from Sac to Fairfield everyday, and the Davis area is slowly driving me insane. For some reason coming back to Sac is always jammed up at Davis. I'm slowly losing my mind, but the Amtrak is too expensive, so I'm stuck just driving. 	It's because the freeway widens from 3 lines to like 5 or 6, and then goes back down to 3.  Horrible design.
None of the relationships from friends really made any sense. It never felt like there was any synergy	I’ll agree with you on the rest of the cast, but I stand by Monica and Chandler forever.
Quasi related note: there used to be a shop upstairs in this weird building on 17th st in Newport Beach called Haley's Comix. Owner was this guy named Jim. This was in '98-'99. Anyone here know what happened to that shop or what he's doing now? I used to go there a lot and ran the shop a couple times while he was out of town and wouldn't mind saying hi to him again.	Think it converted to another comic store/card shop then was subsequently moved across the street and then also closed down.

Well the Freys seem to be the most powerful individual house in the Riverlands. They also have A LOT of land. Also since the Riverlands is filled with vassals that are as strong or stronger than their liege the Tully's are probably the weakest individual great house.	Weren't the Tyrell's also weak, in comparison to their vassals at least? It was my understanding that in terms of man power, several of the Reach vassals were at least equal to House Tyrell.

Yes. I have to eat with my coworkers but what I eat is up to me. I work nights so I can play it off by saying I grabbed something before I left the house and no one is the wiser. 	Yay spooky shift workers 👿 It becomes really easy to make excuses when your time doesnt line up with anyone elses.

Hello there	I missed this chain by daring to sleep. Awesome to meet a general though!
Who knew that 19 games with the worst QBs in the league was enough to completely rule out any future potential for a guy that was a unanimous first round pick two years ago Most seventh round picks get cut anyways. There is just no downside to making this trade. Even if we cut him before the season starts it’s no different than the vast majority of guys drafted in the 7th Edit: Before someone points it out, yes, Coleman has a bigger cap hit than a 7th round pick would, however, it’s still very small relatively speaking. 91 Wide Receivers will have bigger cap hits than him in 2018 	And your Sabres stole Jeff Skinner!!!
This is my entire party. Interestingly enough, it's usually only one at a time. It's like they trade nights or something and when someone does this the entire party tells them to shut up and listen. 	That’s hilarious 
Why is it infuriating 	Waste of everything
pokemongo.gamepress.gg/cpcalc should show you the cost. If it doesn't have a Lucky option in their calculator yet, just divide the stardust cost by 2 to get the cost of lucky.	They do have the lucky option. jfyi
The commute is *usually* fine--took me 30 minutes to get to work in SF. But be prepared for random delays or issues.	35 min by BART, 50 by Ferry from the East End to FiDi. 
Just to be 100% sure, email your college and ask them.	Ok I'll try that, thanks. 
I still haven’t met anyone that’s even met a real flat earther (outside of the Internet). 	I know one, but have never had the chance to ask him about it. Seems like a bright enough guy but I imagine there's some deep seated trust issues that leads him to believe the entire world is lying to him. 
Bought a house in Cane Ridge/Antioch in 2008.  We heard the rumor about it being given a new zip code back then.  Likely not going to happen.	I was looking at homes in Cane Ridge in 2008 and the same story was told to me then too. Hilarious.

Small tip for a spoiler, don't put an obvious spoiler in the title - if someone doesn't know that the leak happened but reads that title, they'll immediately know that Castlevania was leaked. Better title is something like WIP Theme based on leak etcetc	Or he could just not mention the leak. Just say it's Castlevania.
That really makes sense. Why are their feet not the same, they do kinda stick out? 	I am gonna sound like a douch intentionally and point out something. Let's say I am a predator who wanted food, I would look for something obvious like orange.
Yes. lol. There was a great article on rotoworld.com that shows how on average, newly promoted teams have about 35% less goals per game in EPL in year after being promoted.  To be fair, I have Jota in my lineup because he plays up high as a mid.  However 17 goals will be a lot more un-realistic now he has to play Alison, Ederson, De Gea, Burnley, etc and not Norwich, etc... There are proven EPL experienced players in the same price ranges. If 'risk' is your concern start with them until wildcard.. Eg. Cairney -&gt; Hughes Good luck Amigo	Do you know if that accounts for the fact newly promoted teams play roughly 20% less games in the PL? Not criticising your argument but just curious

your rafa and the clock is ticking	u/dog_of_the_house created some of my favorite moments on this sub.  Many credit u/shakenbake90 for being the greatest shitposter to ever grace r/NUFC, but dog takes the trophy in my book.
Can this get stickied to the top of the sub?	Done!
Love your style!!! Keep up the good work	I love you both
You might want to fix your broken tree LODs by re-running DynDOLOD.	Thx! Those pictures were made in 2015 and 2016. Making a really fresh build. Dyndolod will be a part of it for sure.

It isnt a starter pack, it would have had the vbuck icon next to the ingame file of the splash art of the skin like how wingman did when it was leaked. the skin is called “sam_galaxy_lord” in game files so people think it will be awarded to people who play it on samsung galaxy 9	Its probably a Samsung Exclusive. Just like the PS4 exclusive skin was.

Mosquitoes. I mean, of all the species humanity has managed to wipe out by mistake, surely we can do one more deliberately?	Isn’t Elon Musk making a genetically modified mosquito that when it mates with another mosquito, it kills the mosquito then itself?

Are you seriously worried you missed some important equipments / rewards from the literally first person you speak to in the game?	Yeah I wanted her number
I’m interested as well! 	Thank you! Please email with the following: (a) what kind of experience you have, if any, doing related work or volunteering (work that involves approaching and talking to strangers), and (b) your availability next week for a phone or in-person meeting
Please don't do this.	I agree
You are probably limited by an extreme budget, but please consider offering more.  $30 for 18 pages is absurd.  That's .67 cents a word. 	Considering the response I don't think he needs to. Small one off projects like this will always be relatively cheap to produce.

I really want to combine my Sinemia with Moviepass and have an awesome 6 movie a month plan where I can reserve my seats, see a premium format, etc.. and see every movie that interests me (really 4 movies a month is the sweet spot that I don't see myself exceeding, but these blockbuster months it's nice), but MP seems to be incredibly unreliable and inconsistent. No idea what movie you'll see, when you'll see it, where you'll see it, or if you'll even be able to see it.	I have a similar sweet spot of 4 movies, but have no use for the summer blockbusters.  Rather than Sinemia, I think I will do A-List for Oscar Season, then cancel, and keep MoviePass as my indie fallback.  
In the future you might want to turn down the blur. The front of the skateboard being out of focus looks kind of odd, especially since that’s where the eyes are drawn to	Thanks for the criticism

I don't know if he'd be willing to commit to the word "destiny" or even "capacity". You may have an incredible capacity to do something that the environment doesn't value.  But to him, I think, that would mean the TRUTH is that your ability to do whatever that is isn't really a great capacity. 	Do you think it would be more accurate to say that he thinks something is true insofar as it helps his chosen group to *survive* in a Darwinian struggle? Edited to add in a letter I forgot

I have pre-ordered the game on ps4, would all the pre-order bonuses go to the other accounts  as well because I had bought it on an primary account.	No guarantee. It will depend in the developer. Some limit DLC/bonuses only to the account that redeems it, that includes redemption codes in some physical copies.
&gt; Shoutout to u/Dorkside  u/gilles_duceppticon Who? 	I'm pretty sure gilles did the CSS for the sub and was never much of a moderator. Dorkside is one of those guys who is obsessed with being a mod and mods like 50 different TV show subs.
I busted. But I don't give up.	Busted = failed? Fight on. 👍
Is there enough clearance in there for the 2200g's wraith stealth?	Exactly my thought. This case looks really nice, but even on their photos with motherboard and cooling installed it looks like the cover/panel will choke the fan. It feels like you'd have to install a dynatron radiator and depend solely on the bottom fans.
The developer of Anki wrote two years ago in the official support forum: "Custom fonts are supported - please see the following: http://ankisrs.net/docs/am-manual.html#custom-fonts"   https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/ankimobile/3568-custom-fonts-on-iphone-version#comment_38940063 This passage is still in the manual so I assume that it should work. Getting the styling right is not always the easiest thing to do. So you could post the code/templates you use. On the Desktop: Do you have it installed for the whole system or is it in your media folder? An alternative might be to ask in the official forum for AnkiMobile. The developer reads and can access your deck. So he might help you better. 	Oh. Thanks for this. I’ll try post my code there. I think I got my font installed on my desktop

Investigate is potentially my favorite mechanic and I absolutely love this card. The art, the flavor, the balance...   promoting innovative use of Clues...     all around a winner. But I do agree with the memory issues problem...   I'd have him put 2 +1/+1 counters on them and make them a 0/0 instead.	As far as I'm aware, most players keep their noncreature artifacts, especially Clues, separate from their creatures. Given that anything else animating these Clues differently is likely to leave a footprint of its own, I think doing this effect without markers is fine. If it's good enough for [[Skilled Animator]]...

Looking promising. I'm still worried about the writing though, Riverdale's quality went down quite a lot in Season 2, it lost a lot of what it made so unique. 	Riverdale was always treading that line though, it was only a matter of time before they crossed it 
&gt; Manipulative (I am good at reading the room and manipulating things to work in my advantage). Never, ever tell people you are manipulative, even if you are. A good manipulator frames themself as a good leader, or a good communicator or a good socialiser, they don't state their ability to exploit people as a quality (to be fair, a good manipulator should already know this).	Yeah, if I saw 'good at manipulation' on a CV/resume I would be completely aghast. Although it's a handy skill to have towards the higher echelons of cut-throat business, nobody would *ever* want it said in such a way.
I love this! How easy is it to get  the mat in and out of the bag? I’ve just been using a... yoga strap (not sure what it’s really called but it’s just a long nylon thing with metal rings on both ends) to carry my mat, and it’s fine but this is waaaay cuter!	So easy! I used an I hook and it seems to be perfect for my mat (it's a 5mm thick mat). Edit: also there is a bit of stretch in the yarn, so that helps get the mat in and out.
seriousness though, is timmy going to be around this season? would be awesome to see poeltl improve under his tutelage. 	Behind the scenes; of course he will be.

Hello everyone! Tell us about a pc build you’ve completed and what your favorite components were.	I built my last PC ~3 years ago and splurged for a Samsung 950 Pro, the speeds are just incredible.
If you have maxed scans per the codex then Helios will not make additional scans.	And Helios' detect vulnerability only works on enemies with full codex unlocked, in fact you don't even need the investigator equipped to detect vulnerability to work. 
Ok, i like him already.	Slime dude is pretty cool.
i'm continually surprised by the number lvl 70s that don't have their starship yet. So they cant be summoned. Seems just weird to lvl that far, even if you only PvP or Heroic to not do at least that much story. 	all they have to do is start ch1 of KotFE and the ship is given to them. They don't even have to complete the chapter.
Incredible. 	Thanks :)

For anyone interested, solar chargers usually list how much MaH output the solar panel has. Take that number and divide by the size of the internal battery, that's how many hours of solid, sustained, sunlight you need to fully charge that battery. Also if the output from the solar panels is less than what your device draws (spoiler: it always is) it won't keep up. For instance, this [24,000 MaH Solar Powered Battery Pack](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Charger-24000mah-Capacity-battery/dp/B07F63ZWKN/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534300227&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=solar+charger) states the solar panel outputs 1 Watt at 5 Volts. This works out to about 200 MaH. So to charge this battery pack to full on only sunlight would take about 24,000 / 200 = 120 Hours of charging.	You probably want to then multiply that number by ~1.2 to account for the inefficiency of the charging circuit.

I'm with Jalter on this one. Gramps may call it perfect but in reality Gudako's manuscript is still trash. Gramps need to stop his obvious favouritism and be more honest with her.	True enough. He's not helping her grow with blanket praise.

This sale is much better than the previous one. 70% with the additional 15% off newsletter code, brings the prices down a lot more than a few days ago. I’ve been tracking the prices in several items I’ve kept in my cart over the past few weeks. Items for this sale is the lowest they’ve been. 	Anything worthwhile?
Leave highway don’t care alone! 😭	Agreed, love that song! 
the Moog Grandmother is a recent favorite of many. the mother 32 and Boog are also cheaper options if you’re looking for that moog sound. have you heard of the 0-Coast by Make Noise? it’s a very unique and compact semi modular synth that would pair well with your microbrute if you want a more weird/experimental approach. it’s not a subtractive synth but it will teach you about west coast type of synthesis like the buchlas. tho it can be musical, it truly shines when it gets really weird and bleepy there’s also sequencing options like the SQ-1 or the arturia beatstep pro which are great cv controllers all around. 	Thanks for the recommendations. I actually hadn't heard (much) about the 0-Coast. This looks like a good addition.
I'm not sure what you mean by "lavenders rather than just flowers." They do sell fake lavender at places like Hobby Lobby and Michaels, or online on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Unilove-Artificial-Lavender-Bouquet-Decorations/dp/B01N353ZWV). As for how you would attach that to the fursuit, I think that depends on the actual design of the character. Do you have a picture?	oh, and by “lavenders rather than flowes”, i had misspoken. i meant that i’d rather stay true to the character design and use lavenders rather than settling for other faux flowers like fake roses or something along that vein.

Could it not just be that having a mother who gets stressed out more causes the child to be more stressed out as they grow up?

I've usually found platitudes unhelpful too, but I'm here if you need to vent. Have you considered a hotline? They've been very helpful in my experience.

For the 500,000 I sold a bunch of equipment. It was when I realized that there was a limit to how much equipment you could carry that I sold most of it. Got the trophy easily. 	Yeah you can even hard save before it, sell everything, get the trophy, reload. 
A family member of mine has a 2011 G37; Hasn't had any major issues besides a very sensitive tire pressure monitor that goes off anytime there are major temperature changes outside. It's just an annoying alert that doesn't affect the car or our ability to drive it. She's been very happy with the car.  	I had a 2005 G35 for 11 years and the only issue I had was the tire pressure monitor. I realize op is looking for a newer car, so maybe they’ve fixed this particular problem.

If it was easy to let go of ego, every practitioner would be all awoken now. The Buddha’s [last words](http://jayarava.org/buddhas-last-words.html)  is “vayadhammā saṅkhārā appamādena sampādetha”, which means “All things are disappointing, [it is] through vigilance [that] you succeed”. The keyword here is vigilance. To be vigilant, we need to be mindful. Mindful of the ego. Mindful of all phenomena. Sammasatti, which means “right mindfulness”, helps us steer away from delusions of body, selves, minds and mentality. Keep mindful and little by little, we will see we are no longer what we used to think. 	The last words are decay is inherent in compounded things, strive diligently
On a related topic, what about their skincare products (cleansers etc)? Has anyone used any of them and are there any that are actually really good and worth buying?	I use their cleanser in-shower and it's as good as any other cleanser I've used. Their facial sunscreen is the best!

Does anybody remember [this?](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2017/07/28/yadier-molina-mike-matheny-cardinals/520672001/) it kind of makes me think Yadi isn’t at tired as some of you make him out to be. 	He absolutely needs a day. Last night the dude was flailing at every single pitch like he had nothing left in the tank. It kinda hurt to watch.
I’ve noticed Yadi really loaf to 1st on grounders this year. I really wish the first baseman or fielder would commit an error to convince Yadi to start running again	When you’re setting records for consecutive games caught you can loaf a bit on a routine grounder
Now that I have this set properly (sorry. First time on here) I will give ya a bottlecap for the HA froakie.	Thanks!

Totally new here, after lot of research I have bought a Lamy 2k and a couple of Ranga Bamboo pens over the last month. After using 2k using the Ranga pen wasn't too great and I sold 1 of those and kept one since I just love it's looks and will use it once in a while. Now looking to add to my collection and take a step further, willing to spend between $200-$250, which pen will you recommend? 	What do you think of the vanishing points? I've had a 2k, I think they both are on par with one another, but the VPs' design and grip are not for everybody.

I think it would be a neat exercise to challenge designers to draw up a flow chart in [standard format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) for their core resolution mechanism or any other interesting subsystem.

Nice and clean, kinda remind me of first gen ACX design.	For $1200 it better give great head while it's at it.

Question for all the Control Warriors out there, what's your gameplan vs Cube Hunters? I always get demolished.	Warrior has always had bad matchups vs deathrattle decks. You don't have any transformations like poly or hex and brawl sometimes just leads to a worse board state. Run silence effects if you're seeing them a lot

You can try overclocking your monitor refresh rate in the Nvidia control panel. I have noticeably less screen tearing at 75Hz OC compared to default 60Hz. Here are a couple of guides for this: [1](https://www.pcgamer.com/how-to-overclock-your-monitor-to-a-higher-refresh-rate/) [2](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1674-overclock-monitor-higher-refresh-rate) Also you might want to put all your setttings to low and 75% render scale if you want maximum frames and  input lag. Another thing, if you want to test how many frames you will get under maximum load this game can give you, then make a custom lobby with 12 Roadhogs and give them perma ult. I recommend the map fo this to be Oasis university.	Is that a thing? NICE! I will try it right away. Any downsides for overclocking a monitor? Does it get damaged?
I have issues with being able to eat enough, it’s like a mental block or something.	Maybe you should eat protein and calorie rich things then, so you dont have to eat much in order to get enough.

Wait... what, please explain 	A fast food place is advertising burgers that are, for whatever reason, joined together. It then cuts to a news segment on conjoined twins. 
Give that man the arm band next season 	It could be this year unofficially. When Fab gets installed hendo and Milner might not be in the starting eleven. I think the longest person at the club then is Firmino but I wonder if Klopp just hands it to Virgil. 
Could you add me please? She just banned me from her sub after I tried giving her some advice. She’s been setting off a few red flag warnings for a while now, there’s definitely something going on under the surface with her.

she is way to fat to be a communist,	she?
At this point, I think it’s safe to say that 99% of glitter beer is intended to troll the fad chasers. We’re doing a spread of fruited glittery milkshake IPAs for an upcoming festival.

A lot of old MMOs like DAoC and UO will probably never shut down and are worth a look at. One that's got a big playerbase and is a ton of fun is Planetside 2. Darkfall New Dawn seems to be doing well and is the best version of that game. But again it really depends on what you like. Because the big ones you mentioned, to me, aren't even worth playing despite active playerbases, because they don't really do anything interesting. 	Planetside 2 is not a RPG. Is a large scale FPS.

Dataminers: "We dug into the API and found this thing!" Content Creators: "HYPE IT UP: THIS IS COMING 100% CONFIRMED". Community: "CONTENT CREATOR A, B, SAID ITS COMING, ITS TRUE" Bungie: *says literally nothing, releases the item* Community: "REEEEEE THIS ISNT WHAT WAS PROMISED".	It's bugged, the quest wasn't supposed to release yet.

"Is the joke that he has hooves and can't make waffles?" might be one of the stupidest things I've ever heard Doug say. 	No the problem is that donkey looks like Vegas 
WADU HEK Also just a few thoughts : I just hope that riffs aren't removed because of this item. The rifts add a really viable aspect to the game, and forcing players to give up an item slot for a rift isn't the best idea. Plus it adds more RNG to the mix, I assume it's like a launch pad but in your inventory. We'll see how it goes tho. 	To be fair, with launch pad you have to build ramp to get higher. With this portable rift you instantly teleport to the sky, i guess taking one slot is okay
Are we expecting them to sell it?	They still breathe today thanks to this [https://kotaku.com/sources-amazon-spent-big-bucks-on-cryteks-engine-1696008878](https://kotaku.com/sources-amazon-spent-big-bucks-on-cryteks-engine-1696008878)
Sorry, but this dark look is Eclipse ? 	Yeah, the dark mode is Eclipse X.
It's either Conor starches him in the first round or Khabib mauls him like all the other. It all comes down to Conor surviving the first round by not getting taken down. Cause he will land eventually if he isn't on his back	Conor surviving the first round? Like that's an issue. I see your point but c'mon, other than fighting out of his weight class, the first round is not a concern, even against the Eagle.

Jayne really needs to overhaul his streaming set up... this wasn't anything big but it could also have said #trade and a player name. stuff like this can get out of his control very fast.

I am trying to figure out what it is about this that makes is look the way it does. I don't know how to explain it but it doesn't quite look as good as some of the other animated movies like the ones pixar makes. Can anyone chime in that knows about this?	Seems to be just generally in lower quality. Some scenes look just like an older video game cut scene or something. It's lower production value for sure. 
Why are you so fixated on helping us?	Because I resent my parents’ relationship and how fake/hypocritical aspects of feminism is 
You can try depop or etsy, I've used both and can say they are very very good and perfect for selling clothing online. They both have a large user base so if you promote enough you're bound to get traffic.	Awesome, thank you for this! Appreciate it!
Gold was about 20 an ounce in 1790. 2k would have bought 100 oz of gold, which would be worth about 120k now. Gold bugs owned!	Was the $2k invested? How could it just randomly be $6.5million?
Maybe it's because her name was originally "Illyasviel" and longer names cause the name to move over to the left? Because Jeanne Alter also has her J right next to the 100.

do the concept album! pop artists have done narrative driven music, like melanie martinez’s cry baby. loona are also a group thats well known for their intricate “loonaverse” mythology. so theres no reason you cant make a pop album about a fictional universe. the sky is the limit! (and even if they didnt wouldnt it be amazing if u were the FIRST person to do so? just because something hasnt been done before doesnt mean it shouldnt happen) btw since ur independent dont think u cant get ur name out there.

The sites still in early production because we’ve been focusing on fishing the technical aspects but it’ll be done in the next week.
Just wondering if you were able to play the game. If you have, is it p2w? And is it where you reroll to get a good start in the beginning?	http://talesoferin.wikia.com/wiki/Other_Chars I plan on rerolling just because I enjoy having a nice start, they do give you a free 5*. It doesn't seem to be super pvp based but it does have a limit break system that goes up to 10. We'll see how p2w it is in global.
Why just me?	why not?  Ok everybody.
It kinda seems like this person is actually making an informed statement that if a trans man wants to transition and look like a man, then they should not be using the women's room. Though context would be helpful here. 	I think they meant trans woman but said trans man
I am also an annual subscriber still (as of this morning) on the annual plan. I have not received the e-mail. Bought it during the November promotion, not through Costco. It took 2 months to set up and not bill me monthly ("official rebill date is December but it should be January). I have not been able to see a movie I want since July (last saw AM&amp;TW on the 27th). Looking at my history, I average 2 movies a month. I feel like they are specifically targeting their higher users. Doesn't mean they won't "fix" that come Monday. Until they move me, I might stay until the end of my billing cycle (couldn't get it to cancel yesterday anyway). 	I'm in the same exact position. Signed up for annual in November, got charged in January, and average 2 movies a month. Targeting heavy users makes sense, but I am also wondering if they might just be targeting users with later end-dates.

This is a quote that would be good towards someone who is s healthy weight but maybe not as “perfect” looking as they want to be.

Wait, why PPD ?	Look at Bulldog's recent retweet of PPD 
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!	You can build your own DYI motion simulator. There's even an API that supports many games. 
Hi. Which game would you recommend out of: Fulham v Burnley, and Newcastle v Chelsea. Thanks :)	Newcastle/Chelsea. Imagine it'll be a lively affair and Chelsea are looking like a top side. 
I love how much this guy loves the team.	Grazi regazi
2 randoms please	You got 13, 20
How has KB looked besides our game Bills fans? 	bad
This is reversing a tweet that was originally written about women, to show how absurd it sounds	This is a r/woooosh 
Why is this island special? I don't dig the artwork at all. Idk, maybe that's just me but I prefer my islands to look more..islandy	People like the sky.  That cycle looks good, especially in foil.
I've been thinking about this lately in relation to Ableton and push 2, wondering about the smallest Ultrabook or similar that could suitably handle Ableton and allow the push to do is thing ...	Yeah man, I feel like even just having Ableton and a Push 2 would be a really nice workflow/setup and be plenty. Like if I was going MINIMAL-minimal that's def what I would do...although I don't know if I could get by without at least ONE hardware synth...
i hope in the future they will have a page like the list of available movies for the week with discounts per movie it would be nice to have a month in advance to plan a strategy but things are so dynamic is mile 22 a -$2 is happytime ?	it's probably more than just by movie, but also by theater and time.
Once again, bravo! Amazing job.	Thank you! :D
AR3BT and AR5BT didnt impress me, as did anc700bt. Have you check ath ws990bt? ​ Also I would recommend sennheiser hd4.40	Thank will do! Also, nope. They are mostly for bass heads. Not a big fan. I prefer something between neutral and a v-shape. M50x's have mastered the balance! Trust me it pains to even think of abandoning them. But wires keep on distracting and limiting my movement.
Typically, I recite conversations I'll have with other people in case I run into them.  I imagine what they'll say and how I'll respond and so on.  It might be therapeutic if it wasn't a compulsion. 	I'm so glad I'm not the only one that does it. I've been self conscious keeping this secret 
They look similar enough. Am I missing anything?	Look closer at the forsaken clip. Looks like taken energy in the whites of his eyes

If this is money that needs to be accessed in under 5 years, keep it liquid like high yield savings, CDs or iBonds. ​ If you don't need to access the money invest in the stock market: ​ 1. First invest in tax advantaged accounts like IRAs, 401Ks, HSAs (this requires you to have earned income) ​ 2.  If you've maxed all your tax advantaged accounts you can open a taxable brokerage account and invest in tax efficient funds in their (eg. broad market indexes, ETFs, etc).	Is a high yield savings account the same as a regular savings account? 
not competing, just test. I don't think my ligaments or back can handle more.	Then deca is for you. 
key value?	Idk I'm really just looking offers. I dont go just off of price sheets but Rl insider has it at 35-45 so I'm looking for offers around that.
Nebraska is down to 1 scholarship QB - a true freshman. Is there any other appropriate reaction to this besides “Yikes”?	It's definitely scary. I'm not worried about Martinez's ability to play, I'm worried about his ability to stay healthy for an entire season behind a very questionable O-line and a very physical schedule. I would bet money that Bunch takes some snaps this year.
Wouldn't Tyler Wade be our designated pinch runner in the playoffs? 	Wade Isn’t really base stealer. Just fast 
Not my alliance but I'm a part of TheDoods. We're doing decently well and are pretty chill.	What league are you in? We can lower the requirements and let you in no problem. May have to wait though because I’m going to bed right now. 
Memorizing every single darn NRTI's name😐 so many names. Especially since this was at the end of the pharm section in FA. And not even a common suffix 😐	lol these are hard alone... not to mention the rest of HAART. 
Those look great. Jealous we couldn’t get a deal like that in the states. It’s been hard to find the set. 	Just buy it from popcultcha?
they're thin spots, dog.	Nah they're places where my hair parted cos I brushed them at different angles. I fixed it now.
&gt;The solution is simple, give each winner a car. It’s a drop in the ocean for the afl but will cause a mass exodus of the game if this is what is to be expected in the extremely unlikely event of a draw! There isn't going to be a mass exodus based on this. What a ridiculous statement.	yeah nah 
I really like the Lenovo. The ones with a touch screen. They have all the specs you’re looking for too and for that price you could get a wicked one.	Can u send me a link?
What's the game between MGS 5 &amp; Kingdom Hearts?	Thats Kingdom Hearts 2.8 Remix. I meant to get a complete case for that
They better not still have Jared Leto as the Joker	Bro.
what’s the length?	Didn't take measurements, you'll have to look from the pics. I heard xl fits like an M though so you can base it off that
This premium idea is going to irritate a lot of stoolies. This might be the really true big miss by Erika or whoever came up with this idea	Someone said it yesterday, but I would rather pay for access to the free talk thread than for any Barstool content.  We probably get more engagement here than on their website.
Did you mean: La Ronde	Whoops yeah, spelling mistake, sorry
I really can't imagine why Dave would stay married to Amber.  I can't imagine having to constantly reassure someone like that.  Judging by the meal with her friends I think he is seeing this isn't someone he can have a life with.	At some point you have to wonder why Dave consistently says things to her that he knows will set her off. I think he does it on purpose. 
The short answer is No, if you’re playing with a casual group, there aren’t combos that will make people happy. Casual decks are built to create a gamestate they enjoy and play in that gamestate until they eventually come out on top.  Competitive decks are built to end the game with themselves on top.  Even if both are trying to win, casual decks that succeed still end up with a game being currently played whereas competitive decks intend to end the playing. Combo is the latter	Combo is not inherently competitive.
Wouldn't shock me if he learnt to say 'r' just do he could say it	its a motivating factor
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this kinda big for the side bar?	It is, but there should be another version in the comments. Probably won’t fit, but I’ll tweak it.

Weird, don't have this issue on my OnePlus 6. Maybe try clearing the app data and see if it makes any difference?	How do I do that?
Who are your favorite "old-school" players? I got into the scene relatively recently and feel like I'm missing out on so much of the formative history of smash, and I'm always intrigued to learn more.	https://bignokh.com/2018/03/02/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-pikachu942s-honorable-mentions/ https://bignokh.com/2018/02/17/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-91-100/ https://bignokh.com/2018/02/19/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-81-90/ https://bignokh.com/2018/02/22/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-71-80/ https://bignokh.com/2018/02/25/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-61-70/ https://bignokh.com/2018/02/27/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-51-60/ https://bignokh.com/2018/03/03/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-41-50/ https://bignokh.com/2018/03/06/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-31-40/ https://bignokh.com/2018/03/08/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-21-30/ https://bignokh.com/2018/03/12/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-11-20/ https://bignokh.com/2018/03/14/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-6-10/ https://bignokh.com/2018/03/16/the-top-100-melee-players-of-all-time-the-final-five/
Need washed and ironed but terrified to start that yet lol, did this over 4 days (after running out of thread once lol) I managed to make a mistake on one of the letters but I'm gonna leave that in I think. Pattern is from https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/603488824/not-feeling-very-talky-today-off-you-fck	It doesn't even look like there's a mistake
Way better. I still don't love him covering tight ends but he will be able to play man a lot more and be around the los which is what made him a great college player.	He played Ertz decently the other day I thought. 
Kaycee about Tyler: He's so skinny. Angela: He's so like...healthy. He needs to put some calories in his body.	kaycee: hes disappearing

Really cool, but belongs in /r/NintendoSwitch or /r/Nintendo	Okay, sorry! I'll post it there. Thank you!
Banshee Chapter Donnie Darko The Jacket Tideland (may not be considered horror, but it should be) Actually, i’ll add Yellowbrickroad to the list.  If you’re talking creepy that stays with you and gets you talking afterwards ... good or bad ... that’s one that shouldn’t be missed.	I don't think I've ever come across anyone who has seen Tideland! Such a bizarre movie that I still think about!
In N Out burger	Those are good burgers, Walter.
alright what did they do this time?	Happy cake day my friend. 
Things more boring than bye week	Freo v Port matches. Also known as Ross Lyon vs Ross Lite. 
Looks amazing! Very natural, I love the look of the Val flowing along the surface.	Thanks! That's exactly what I was going for. I prefer a more natural/overgrown look than something that looks like it was aquascaped.  And it's actually not Val, it's Sagittarius Filiformis. Easy to mistake as Jungle Val though.
Is that not the capital of Gondor...?	I totally see it! although I wasn’t thinking about that when I drew it
A mix of a little bit of sand, and a LOT of coconut fiber (the leading brand that comes in the plastic bags. Eco Earth?). Works very well :)	What kind of sand do you use?
This subreddit is for cats that appear to behave like liquid e.g. assuming the shape of the container they are in. Very lovely kitten, but this photo doesnt belong here. 	Oh ok. I’m sorry. I’d seen other posts like this. I’ll remember that for next time.
I don't think a coop/raid mode would be possible. The game can barely support two players at a time, more would probably break things entirely. Though I do like the idea of more characters. I'd like to see some kind of iron man/endurance run where you face a gauntlet of characters back-to-back.	Ooh thats interesting. I would luke to see that as well
Did you post this to /weather?	for the lazy/mobiles: /r/weather
You're living with them, they are your landlord. I was required to disclose my income, as well as proof of work, to my landlord. Presumably, they'll be charging you rent at far below market rate? They're probably just asking so they know what's a fair amount to charge you. What are you concerned about when they find out? I would just tell them, they're your parents and they're doing you a favour by letting you back in, they're not obligated to you in the same way unless you plan on charging them rent.	Okay that makes sense. I dont know what I was concerned about, its just theyve both always been very cagey about their salary so I thought it was odd that they wanted to know mine.
Hold on, I will be back in a bit with absolute PROOF that 12pm exists.	THERE! I FOUND PROOF THAT 12PM EXISTS! Today, at exactly 12 pm, 12 pm existed for a WHOLE HOUR. Be shocked.
Whats the new thing on it? The vehicles?	Plus one confirmed skin for Grievous, and two for Obi-Wan.
For around $1200 laptop, how well does it hold up? 	Holds up really well
Most people dating at this age are pretty sure about what they want usually a couple dates in they know if you are compatible or not because you have been around the block a few times. Sounds like you guys werent in the same space. A for instance I met my SO and after 2 mo we moved in after a yr we had bought a house, when it feels right you want to move fast. You may miss her but dont think she was right for you.	if you don't mind my asking, what ages where you and your SO?
Best of luck man. Good on you for recognising the problem early as well	Thanks a lot man 
&gt; Or am I missing something? You're missing something. "Without hierarchy or authority?"  Why wouldn't there be hierarchy or authority? LAWS will "prevent" private property. 	Who enforces the laws and how is that not authority?

Lot of unknowns. Depending on the need, higher frequencies give much better performance compared to more cores at lower frequencies. Plus, I don’t think anyone expected a 48/64 core to have higher frequencies than a 28 core at similar power ratings.	With 8,000 nodes, I highly doubt clockrate is a limiting factor for workloads that scale out that far. The article seems to mention AVX512 in relation to "clock rate", which doesn't make any sense.

Ah yes, the classics of world literature: Macbeth, The Odyssey... ...and The Fault in Our Stars	Literature can have value regardless of personal opinion. If it encourages young people to read, why not include it?

Awe ok some people are just built small. Do you feel healthy? Are you happy with your body? 	I am healthy as far as I know and yeah 
When a lich reforms, does it look like it did as a human? no rotting flesh or anything?	I like this idea because now I'm thinking about how a party could trick a lich into revealing the location of its phylactery by playing on its vanity.
Why wouldn't the dev add this to the Unity Asset store? It's better than most of the ropes I've seen.	We will think about this. First we need to release the game :)

if you need to waste 3 nat 5 is just not worthed unless they are all awesome and you are just way too tired of nat 5. most players should just play it safe and save their nat 5 for themselfs.	It definitely will be a feature for veteran players (or whales), who have had a big lack of content recently.  Just like nat4 rebirth for newer players, it won't be worth it until you have a bunch of good things built with extra mons piling up.
Honestly you captured two styles of the art. One looks like MGS1 the other like MGS2. Beautiful work regardless.	Thanks :)
Yeah, we are out of pocket too 😞.  That’s the worst because you have to be mentally AND financially ready.      Meanwhile I’m surrounding my friends having baby #2 and #3 without even trying.  I’m sorry you have to go through more testing, but I wish you guys the best in your next step. 	Yeah,  know what you mean.  Thanks, and good luck!🤞
I know The Athletic rubs some people the wrong way but I really recommend this article, it takes a in depth look at how the Penguins play in their own zone. I believe the Athletic allows a certain amount of free articles a month if you’re not one to want to pay for it. Very basic summary is that the Pens generally have a puck-side overload strategy to outnumber the opposition. Also the author notes while the Pens had defensive woes last season, more of that was a result of their transition game. Also he feels Jack Johnson will do well in a system like this. The full article goes into much better explanation and detail 	You the real MVP 
Literally any 10-series card will be a huge upgrade from what you have. Theres no reason to wait. Even a 1050 is 3x as powerful. But for 4K 30+ FPS you'll probably just get by with a 1070. 	Yup
Tough people make good times. Good times make weak people.	Very great saying!
I've had the same feeling. It didn't make sense that they have us these two events when they should have been held until next year. Then when they added the Academy Adventures feature, it felt like something for new players that stumble into the game to get into it and feel like there's lots of content. It's also telling that there aren't any rumors for events after this one ends in two weeks.	They already announced what the next event would be...
I have no idea what a defender is supposed to realistically do 20 yards up field at full speed when the receiver spins into him 	shake his hand and compliment him on a very good play...
$110? Way too much for this. 40-50 would have been great. 	Should be about 80 when retailers get it. No way it would be 50. The pulse bf retails for 50 and it’s made out of reclaimed garbage. 
Wow! Wow! Wow!	Good Fight! Good Fight! Good Fight!
You messed up bro. He was just about to offer you 25% of your asking price.	Nooononono, that's not how that works. He was gonna have the car held for him, make a date, come by (or ask for OP to come to him) and **then** offer 25% which OP should just accept because they're already there, so...

\[Global\] I'm about 18 fragments from getting SD to (SS) and I don't have any significant Gacha for her. &amp;#x200B; Is there a reason to keep actively farming fragments given the relative rarity of mecha DPS, or should I ease off after raising her to SS?  It looks like from her SSS unlocks she gets a a 3rd clone from her ultimate and some other less impressive but still decent stuff, so it looks like she gets a good bump (and would get a very nice one if I had Raikiri). &amp;#x200B; If I were to stop farming her I'd be switching to Chariot or Divine Prayer (both about 20/100 fragments to SS)	I think you should farm for multiple SS valk instead of focusing all your resources into one SSS. Coming content (raid) would require you to have a more balanced team of valk.
As a soon to be builder for my first PC, I love these kinds of threads. Thanks for info. 	&lt;3
It's not even that close to a building... I want to see someone doing this and ask them what their thought process is.	At this point, I think it'll just be /r/ucf redditors trying to out do one another by parking these things in the most ridiculous places.
My wife looked at a place 25+ years ago, and while it didn't have a toilet, it did had a tub in the kitchen.  And, RIGHT next to the tub, where you'd likely step when getting out, was a floor outlet.	That’s so the toaster can easily reach when you realize how bad things are.
Nice.	Nice.

I take protein powder with milk. 30g protein powder in 500ml low fat milk, which will be 40g of protein in one meal, and I  also consume a small meal containing atleast 15g protein within an hour of consuming the shake. But today I read somewhere that, body can't absorb more than 30g in one serving, and atleast there should be a 2 hour gap before big protein intakes, for the body to absorb more protein. How true is this ?	It's not true.

Due to our financial situation, I’m not angry. The long-term future of our club is more important than a decent CL campaign. I’m just disappointed that Albayrak explicitly stated that we’re going to make up to 2 transfers to replace Bafe. Without that statement, we wouldn’t be as salty as we are right now.	If they had said we are not getting anyone then everyone would be upset but understanding. They chose to straight up lie and it's going to put deserved pressure on them. It's going to get real ugly if we lose to trabzon and quit europe before January.
What’s in the cart	Fish? Or maybe a pub-sub.

I’m trying to help my mom out with wedding guest attire. The events dress code says “typically this venue would recommend formal attire” but guest should “wear what you will be comfortable in”. It’s in SF at 5pm in September. She doesn’t want to look matronly obviously but I’m having a hard time finding things that don’t read too young. It’d be best if it wasn’t sleeveless and a length that would be flattering for a short woman without heels. She’s more of an apple shape so I tend to stay away from fit and flare/other waisted things. She has amazing runners legs so I’m thinking just above knee. [this](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/eliza-j-lace-sheath-dress-regular-petite/4961359?origin=category-personalizedsort&amp;breadcrumb=Home/Women/Clothing/Dresses/Wedding%20Guest&amp;color=coral) is the best I’ve found. Thoughts?	A fit n flare is actually th best shape for apples, waist definition is a necessity
give me the stop motions Wes Anderson	Same. I would love him to adapt more kid's books too.
I’d be interested in buying if you decide to split from the case. I know it’s a PITA but t figured I’d mention in case anyone is looking for a wooden case.	I would be willing to sell it separately if I get an offer for it without the case first. Don’t want to be selling the case first. Pm me if you were looking for the keyboard w/o case. 
I’m really glad football is back but after spending a whole summer watching soccer, I just can’t stand all these commercials. 	So true!
Seems about the same? Is that DMC4 footage with or without turbo? 	Yeah it's the same, it's turbo OFF
Flair League: ERod (can't keep) for Manaea ($5 keeper) sound fair? edit: I'm out of the playoffs	Are you out of the playoffs?
Erik's car was the best or the second best on the long run, but it took him 10 or so laps to get up to speed, and by that time he's lost 3 or 4 seconds. Just no way you can win with a car like that when there are several late cautions.	Tell us about it.
Another prime example of Natural selection. Don't double and triple warn the stupid, it slows science and human progress	The article's about teens. Teens are old enough to have procreated, so if the reason they chose to use these pesticides is genetic (and therefore impacted by selection), those genes would still continue on to the next generation.
Ik I'm dumb, but what's a union? I've heard of them, but I'm not sure of their point	It's pretty much a group of workers in an industry that come together as a singular voice to their employer and work together for a relationship that keeps both parties happy.
Congrats!! That's awesome! I turn 30 in November and set a goal earlier this year to get under 50 mins, myself. A little over a week ago when the weather eased up and wasn't 90+ degrees with 50%+ humidity, I got it down to 51:45, so I don't think I'm going to have trouble breaking 50 in November... My problem with the phone stoppage at the end is the immense sweat I have going on! Sometimes I can't unlock it and my screen starts glitching out thinking it's being pressed where there is sweat on it. So I know how frustrating it is to finish the run and have the pause time, I'll have to try the Strava trick too. Anyway congrats, and that's a great time!	Thanks. You'll easily get under 50 by November. You're lucky to have such less humidity, here in Mumbai it is always around 70%.
The rearview mirror in most vehicles has a tab at the bottom that you can flip to reduce glare from the headlights behind you. (A lot of people may already know that but almost no one I know in real life seems to)	Found out recently, use it all the time now
What happens when he throws another 5 interceptions in a single game? Will this sub be calling for Josh Allen to start?	Josh Allen will be starting. Without question. You simply can't continue to play Peterman if he plays like that.
Trilogy?	Yes it was. Trilogy II, I believe. I didn’t realize just how big their operation was until I was leaving Maui and saw their ads at OGG. For anyone who’s interested check out their link [here](https://redesign.sailtrilogy.com/?utm_expid=.7EO_mYUhTKeDT7tAJAz4fA.1&amp;utm_referrer=) Aside from no wind, it was lots of fun. 
Any tips on how to do euros almost every time because it be making me pump fake?	If you're dribbling with the right hand, move the right stick to the left without holding turbo and vice versa for the other side. To do the eurostep dunk, follow the same step to do a eurostep then hold r2 and move the right stick down.

It has to do with the nature of the electric field in the channel. For a given VDS &gt; VGS, as you move along the channel from the source to the drain, the magnitude of the electric field seen from the gate to the channel decreases. When the device is operating in saturation, the electric field goes to zero at some point in the channel before the drain -- this is known as "pinch-off". 	Thank your for your explanation, I appreciate it.
Did you drink 5 whole marijuanas?	yes
Your posts are always amazing. 	thanks!

This was just embarrassing... what have they been doing the past two months? 	Building team chemistry, Grayhound-style^^(/s) Clearly what ever they were doing had nothing to do with chemistry. Perhaps they all took biology classes at the local community college?

Get yourself an Aerocoast EFB II. Hooks to the front of the Stealth. I will never use anything else but that bag for the rest of my career. Meal prep and bring food as much as you can. Airport food is expensive, and unhealthy. Buy Ecco shoes. They’ve lasted me more than one season of de-icing in Chicago, which is more than I can say about any of pair of shoes I’ve had. A Cut Above for shirts, everything else will fit you like a trash bag	Alright so I'm constantly humming and hawing over a new bag.  Any idea if that thing will fit a 15" laptop?  Also, is there enough room for food and also like...stuff?  You know how it is, chargers, sunglasses, flashlights, blah blah blah...

Guys, can you please look away for like a week or something? We have some stuff to sort out, and it's pretty embarrassing at the moment.	Hear hear!
The whole situation just screams "We really love Stoffel, we don't know why we hired Carlos, but we had to boot him because otherwise Dr. Marko would have stolen Lando. We're actually really sorry but the same way we handle our competitiveness, we handle our drivers." 	&gt;We're actually really sorry but the same way we handle our competitiveness, we handle our drivers." Blame the engine supplier?
Ouch	I could be wrong but I think at the last second they throw their arms in front of their face to break the surface tension of the water...like you would a normal dive. But I’m not sure. Need someone to confirm.

The animated series was the best.	My childhood favorite along with ninja turtles lol
Remember they probably filmed this during early summer when the heatwave was just starting. This “Hot Tent” is gonna be a common theme. 	Would it really have been too much to ask for the producers to stump up for some air con units for the tent? It's not like it's the first time they've struggled with the marquee acting like an oven. 
Any reason to not turn in all my crucible, vanguard, and gunsmith tokens/mats when I get home? Besides the soft cap which I'm not worried about. Got 176 level ups to turn in. 	sounds like there is now a lot more uses for legendary shards. Might be worth it to get those.

By truffle you mean truffle oil right? 	Yes, and I have to say the other comments are actually correct, that part of it didn’t turn out as great as I’d hoped. Probably would’ve been better to just use some truffle salt.
At that point they might as well just make their own game	on the other hand, it'd be decent for landing a game dev job.

Even though the cooler looks terrible, still would've bought this. Yes I do think the 1080s will go lower, but you're chances of getting those anytime soon are very poor. I'd say if 1080s go anything below 325 range get them. With 1070s like 250 range. Keep HODLing brothers, patience is a virtue.	Coolers been fixed since 2016
Yeah this is weird... i mean, it looks like the kind of random insult you'd give to someone in an online game... if he has proof, then publish it? I've always backed Elon Musk as one of the greatest innovators of our time, with his contributions in the push for space exploration and clean energy for motor vehicles etc... This doesn't change the fact that Elon has done many good things, but cmon man, if you're gonna accuse someone of something like that, at least give some credible arguments involving evidence to your claims.	Apologies and self reflection are badly out of fashion these days :( (This seems to be an especially baffling case!)
Considering he's already confirmed as being in the game, it is likely Grevious will have *some* sort of dialogue, yes. 	The "#soon" implies the tweet as a whole is a tease of some sort, no?
should make some difference on some games but honestly I would invest in a new platform at this point	Yeah thing is I do not really have money for that anytime soon, so if I could strech a couple of years with this one, would be great haha.

The ps4 is a great system, the exclusives are really great, and the system runs really well, I have pretty much every new system other than a pc, I am on my ps4 all the time. It’s a good system it doesn’t always have to be connected to the internet. The required updates don’t happen that often. When they do they don’t take long. You can download a game while playing, which for a console is pretty good. It’s really worth it. If you can afford a pro go for it, if not just try to find. 1tb it really makes a difference. 	Yeah already ordered! And I have external hard drives I can plug in for extra storage! Thank you! :)
Mainstream music, tried to get into it and nope wasn't for me.	As if this is a meaningful category at all
I'm guessing at least 45 minutes since he's the 2nd opener (An Horse being the first, and they're amazing by the way).

There's a specialization for the compression dynamo that greatly enhances the effectiveness of Grassoline, isn't there? A nice setup though, there's something nice about having it be quiet and not annoying to your ears.	The Agitative Manifold is what you're looking for.

There are many ways I can think of that Rockstar can make the Online better, like the Cops update where you could arrest other players.

PLEASE tell me the sense, the USE for the Scramjet... What... What is the point?
Do mobs not get howl debuff? then your level\level of howl is not enough to deal with monster level.	Ok, could be I’m level 44 in NM. I feel like Act1 should be ok but I’ll go back to normal.
Even if they did want to revert the change, It would kinda of be impossible what with how many people bought rocket pass and players levels have been changed.	They could leave the levels all that would change is the way you get XP they could Also do the same stuff for score but just make it a flat 1000 XP for winning

The purpose it serves is that you can use the mouse and keyboard to navigate the cliff house. It's actually pretty cool because a little mouse cursor pops up and moves around in the 3D space. It's useless though. It should be able to be disabled.	I've seen that happen but clicking on things does nothing for me.

However, it would be smart to take an extra step in precautions to add signage to your vehicle, or telling thr pax when then enter your vehicle. 	I have stickers that say “dash cam audio video “ I also have “for your safety dash cam audio video active” in my driver profile

What a lovely dress. May I ask why you never wore it?	I found one that better suited my outdoor October wedding! 
Is it just me or were interceptions insanely high this week? Peterman, Roethlisberger, Stafford, Carr, Titans QBs...	Just not Joe Flacco :D
#Hyourding	That's fine. Hopefully you'll get him fast and then you can come back and do what you need to raid wise.
I wonder which pop-star will make an appearance in the next season. 	If it’s Ed Sheeren again I wanna see his face cut off and worn by Arya but maybe that’s just me
We are same height and same starting weight albeit different genders haha. If you were able to lose 44 lbs then you can definitely lose the rest! You are already looking so much better and I hope you stick with it. This world needs more beautiful Amazonians 😊	44.0 lbs ≈ 20.0 kilograms ^(1 pound ≈ 0.45kg) ^(I'm a bot.

Why this game isn't available in the ps store?	Unfortunately, I don’t know the exact details, but a marvel license expired, which is why this game as well as the ultimate alliance games are no longer available through PSN, I’m not sure of which others.
I thought Bruce was going to be on the Midas Letter at 3pm?	He is but there are other guests first. Looks like he'll be on around 4:30
Maybe I can take your mind off it? 	Off of what?
but can you place corner vines...	Yes, you can place vines manually on any side of the block you want now. 
her hand cut off?	Oh, it looks like but its the perspective
Only Virgins drink Salted Caramel Mochas?	Maybe that’s why I like them so much 
He was just there. I guess they think they have enough time for him to retire in style in a month and take a nice cushy position convenently in the Vatican	If he is retired to rome this will just expose all of them
I saw one on shelf in a Best Buy (yes the wireless, and not the HERO g pro 203/102 shape) but it wasn’t in inventory and there was supposedly only one, so I guess they’re still distributing. Maybe some employees will answer, but in my experience most know just as much or less than any one of us.	Where was this? US. Northeast?
They’re actors hired by the cameraman to try and get more views. 	Crisis sharks
12 team Full point PPR worth using my #1 claim on Lindsay or Enunwa? RB: Gordon, Collins, Conner, Ingram, Barber WR: Hopkins, Cooper, Sanders, Lockett, Crowder	Leaning Enunwa as well since you're much stronger at RB.
Still exists	It was discontinued in 2001 and replaced with Pibb Extra. http://theplaincheese.com/flashback-sad-story-mr-pibb/
The Avatar has much to learn.	But I believe Aang can save the world 
Another cashgrab update. You can literally see crystals spending content everywhere. And still no news for increased or guaranteed CCF drop. Sad.	They're not going to increase the CCF drop for a while, there are only 6 T3 characters.
I used to think that that phrase was related to camping, like staying in one spot for hours, ya know, like you "pitch a tent in the bathroom" bc you feel sick. I was very wrong.	What does it stand for?
but what if you're mid?	You say one of two things: GG NO WARDS or GG &lt;insert support's name here&gt; FEEDER!
First issue already, mouse steering is broken and doesn't work.	Yup, same for me. Don't have my wheel with me at the moment so I had to try it, but mouse steering was a no go. Keyboard controlls works, but driving with a keyboard is just weird. Oh well, game seems to run well at least.
The best system I have seen is a small pad poured every 6 to 8 feet in parallel.  They should be the on center with the frame of the home.  Each pad is 24" deep and 24" in diameter.  Then standerd 8" concrete blocks. Layed two side by side then two on alternative direction until the height that is needed is reached on each pad.	What do you mean in parallel? On centre sound like down the centre of the building, but parallel sounds like around the edges. I'm curious, but ocnfused.
Cheese sticks.	Ahhh see what ya did there. But wings are better. 
Screenwriter. Memory recall and focus are big.	How'd you get into that line of work?
I have a job for a IT professional. Dat recovery from a external hard. 	Is it full time?
Congrats! Probably guessing he's Masters personal Teddy bear from now on.	*you bet he is*
My current Empire value  is 660,000,000. The property is worth 120,000,000.	Yes, take it.
Remember when by Bad Wolves.	What's the story behind it?
If you want to see it in a different way with all variables you can use this site. https://earth.nullschool.net	Fabulous site. Thanks for sharing.
My DS4 is not working properly at all. Using ds4windows as usual it works fine with fh3 but not this game. Like I can navigate the menus but only the analog/dpad and shoulder buttons register. Turning with the Senna it's like the input is being cut off and them back on constantly so I can't turn properly at all and end up crashing. Same thing pressing R2. x and o don't select or go back in the menu. Anyone that's using a DS4 can chime in?	worked for me using ds4windows tool, no issues whatsoever
the fact that I get paid just to watch cat video at work and score myself free F1 ticket through my company's partner	any ticket to spare :P
I seriously hope Shadow is revealed. I would buy a switch for that purpose.	I'm looking forward to his amiibo
I cleared it under 6 minutes, and got a reward. #1 in my friends list ^^^^^/s On another note, when are they gonna gives us a proper hard boss rush with all the toughie bosses in one stage?	Boss rush 12 confirmed
If you can't reach 1,2,5 you'll have to play the lower G and Ab with 1. If you absolutely can't manage it, omit the lower G, rather than the lower Ab to maintain the discord.	So i really cannot reach with 1,2,5 should I roll it or just leave out the bottom g?
Or they could wash them &amp; let random people use any of them.	But that would be so icky using someone else's cup. I mean, it'd be like practically every other restaurant on planet earth that doesn't use disposable cups.

Very powerful in EDH.  Not sure about its playability in Standard, though...	Seems kind of worse than it's previous version though (For EDH).  Hexproof and the no-mana requirement  to become a copy seem like they're worth more than the 2 mana discount. Then again, this guy probably has combo potential that I can't see at this point.
Strangely, in computerbase and pcgameshardware.de benchmarks 580 is leading the 1060 by 1fps, also avg fps is lower than gamegpu.	There's nothing strange about that. Different locations tested means different results. You think all these sites test the exact same location in every game?
Why did he capitalize "Billions of Dollars" like some kind of book title or something 	Glad someone else noticed, he think 'dollar' should be capitalized, that's pretty telling of him. I wonder if he's done that before
Love this pic. I’m left waiting to hear what it seems you are about to say, over your shoulder.	Let’s just imagine it’s something brilliant...or dirty. Take your pick 😄😘
Will this be the chosen thread?	i hope not
I am grateful that my daughter is enjoying her new school and has reconnected with old friends. I am grateful that the weather is mild and nice even if it is not raining. I am grateful that I have a good job	Take some time to absorb the moment and appreciate the present :D and hug your daughter too 
I would just like to have benchmark in terms of performance on best VR games. I will certainly buy a Pimax if it is good, but the next question in my mind is how much i also need to invest in a new computer. No way on earth i am buying a product that i cannot enjoy on latest game because the GPU cannot follow.	That makes sense. What CPU and GPU do you have in your computer? 
Mine was always [Kaze No Ne](https://youtu.be/7v8lG0uVTLg). It's the one that always pops into my head when I think of CC.	This one, and the [boss theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahpZD0QE-w), definitely. Both of them pop up in my head, even years after playing the game.

Ouch.  You'll have a lot of down time.  Check out Dr. Rhonda Patrick's website.  She has a lot of tips on increase your stem cells and tissue regeneration.

So just looked up records, &amp;#x200B; If Tyler wins both the F4 and F3 HoH, then he ll be on the leaderboard for all time HoH wins w 5. If either Kaycee or Tyler go 2/2 in the next two vetoes, then they tie Janelle/Paul/Daniele for most veto wins. &amp;#x200B; If JC continues with his losing streak, he ll probably be up there with Dr. Will/Kevin for most PoV/HoH comps without a win. The number is 21 apparently. Lol.	Kevin BB11? I thought he was good at comps lol

"Glide position" probably will be the re-entry configuration to provide maximum pitch control, like the delta wings on the 2017 design. This thing would also glide like a brick.	So like the shuttle then.
When I was young, and dumb, I was working on an Exchange 2010 environment at 1AM from home trying to figure out why Backup Exec hadn't backed up the database for the last 2 weeks (Yeah I was dumb enough not to make a big deal out of that). I dismounted the database through the GUI and it completely disappeared - couldn't find it anywhere or see it in the original file location. I got it mounted through powershell eventually but that was a scary time - really shook me up and changed how I work. i.e. I work professionally.	&gt; Backup Exec hadn't backed up the database for the last 2 weeks (Yeah I was dumb enough not to make a big deal out of that). If it makes you feel any better, that wasn't out of the ordinary.

I love the long hair! (I have a thing for long hair)	good man
I thought Mo Hurst was better than both, no?	Hurst is a rotational guy who needs to become more stout against the run.
Can we take a moment to thank MGK for sacrificing his career so we could get this awesome diss track from Eminem 	What career tho He got bigger from Em's diss than anything. Maybe could argue that Camila song but that's it

In MHGU how do you unlock the ability to buy Pokke Tickets G? I'm at 3056 rep points with the village and completed all the G Hub requests so far. HR70ish but only at Village 8 so far if that' the problem (been neglecting it). Thanks.	I have them unlocked. I have completed village 10☆ urgent and unlocked the advanced quests, HR70ish, and my village contribution is at 3k. Guess you need to do village quests then
Spirited Away was one of the movies which literally stopped the time around me. It shook me to the core. 	Didn't want it to end
This sounds awesome, although my writing experience is not good, but I want to get better and improve. I have so many things in my head, but I just need to train my brain how to make it come alive in words. What would the story be about?	Not sure yet. That would be up to the group.

I didn't think it would take too much effort to sell [this Rex Ambassador](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shave_Bazaar/comments/9cfxcp/wts_rex_ambassador), but I still have it. Dropping the price to $150 shipped (US, F&amp;F). Edit: Sold. Thanks, guys.	Damm, that's an awesome price. I already have one though. 
Also obvious if you use a vaguely modern editor for commit messages like `micro`.	Calling dibs on the name "milli" for my next editor. 
My dinky 2013 dodge dart takes super and that car cost 20k, its not just Ferraris and lambos that use super	  Chances are good that your Dart does not require super. 
It just looks.. fake kinda. Like a rendering.	No way...  I think this is a photo from the old Calgary Science Centre.  This would have been between the ground level and the top.

Aquaphor is the best thing I've ever used for dry lips! It works so fast and so well!	+1000 on the Aquaphor recommendation, it saved my lips last winter and now I use it morning, noon, and night as a prepping treatment layer.
Ah, this is the thread I need. Failing to close down 3 game in a row, including a 2+ score lead with 15 to go in two of them. Unbelievably incompetent	don't forget the pre-season friendlies, giving Mulvihill an astounding record of 0-5
Listening to Tito makes me feel like I am the one with brain damage.	Let me tell you how you feelin' right now?
There have been a lot of headlines like this lately, that is exciting. I really hope some of the more sensible GOP donors are starting to feel the societal pressure against supporting a party that brought us a constitutional crisis as soon as their guy was sworn in.	My favorite recent one is Rick Wilson. His book about it is delicious and should not be missed.

great work! woo!	Thanks.  Who would think it will be so hard 
Is it because they have little holes in them?	I would say the ceramic has holes in it but the cup doesn’t have any holes.
Do y’all think North Carolina is gonna be okay? I mean both state and ship 	The Showboat can take it. She always was a well maintained museum ship. Not like the SUB that was at Patriots Point in Charleston 
Is the Early Fall Smiles pack worth it? With *and* without considering the fact that I need gems for Sky Kotori.	I like to expect the worst possible outcome with packs, so I'm never disappointed by them. Is 5 Rs and an SR "worth" $11 to you?
I have been updating my games directly on switch but not playing online. I dont know if I'm banned but what matters is I can update it freely for now.	Do you have your games as .nsp or .xci? I’ll give it a try!
Honestly, when I see the Portrait that pops up when someone picks her all I see is Jessica Nigri. Edit: http://imgur.com/gallery/V9De1wL Idk maybe I'm alone.	Not alone, it was the first thing I thought of the first time I saw it.

Nice pic! 	Thanks! 
Artery nugget and Sirem V2 22 is a nice tiny setup. Or if external batteries are an option get a Pico to pair with the Siren V2 22.	Second that: Artery Nugget X with Cthulhu Hastur Mini (Siren 22 is too tall, Berserker Mini too annoying to fill; the taste doesnt differ much between the 3)
Hey look that's what makes up 63% of our country. Wierd.	Formerly &gt;80% soon to be &lt;50%
From what I remember, the next gen DLC came out of no where.  We were all pretty sure the original game was going to be it... So who knows.	So there is hope 😁 (potentially)
Nebraska at 0-2 ranked #46 over Minnesota at 3-0? 	Also had me confused...

Ask her to refer you to someone in the area. She’ll get a finders fee. She will have limited value working in an area she doesn’t know. She won’t know what’s improving or what’s changing. 	Yeah, that's probably what I might do. Although since she is family I need to approach it with some due diligence first. I don't want to hurt any feelings not asking her to help me. 
Lol, it will easy. Not joking most 12 year olds would be able to assemble a pc. The biggest trick is finding the best balance and quality of parts for the budget. 	Replacing a PSU seems harder than building a PC, you have to remove all these wires and rewire them while not touching or removing anything important
Yeah, he’s kinda the new face of the team.	"Erik, we just paid for all these ads. You have to re-sign now or at the very least win us the Cup this season".
Yall ever watch Ozark? This show is absolutely absurdly stupid and I love it. 	Good stupid like The Room or bad stupid like Fant4stic from 2015?
Maybe it's a produce crate? We have a bunch of different kinds of these in my store. Produce crates don't have the "door" that egg crates have.	No its an egg crate, none of the produce crates are the exact same size as the egg crates, and the tosca number was the same 
I never littered except once. When I was in Boy Scouts I was riding in the bed of my dads pick up. I spit out my gum while he was driving. He immediately stopped. And told me to go find it. I eventually found it in the sea of grass. I felt so embarrassed and bad about it too. I’ve never littered since.	That sounds more like natural composting than littering.
I like shorts! They're comfy and easy to wear! 	And I like you 😘
It looks like yes, if they are in the same [state.](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012927607-Coverage-Areas) Check your state for further details.	I’m in Illinois and am currently going to Bloomington market but apparently the Springfield market stretches to my city but no coverage in the bigger city (Peoria) at all. But each market has it own boundaries it appears that bump up to each other 
Pro tip: get a motorcycle and you will find a consistent source of happy	Confirmed! Source: I'm on a bike everyday and helps me even when I don't feel physically good. It's like getting on a regenerative device.
Remember when Ronaldo was Gareth's idol?	He thought he was Ronaldo. They don't love him like that
I'm used to programming on platforms where the parameter for Sleep is in milliseconds. This confused me a little at first.	some platform throw to 0 the priority of your app in case that consume lot of CPU. so adding a 1ms sleep just reset the internal timers and your app will run with high priority
That OL is still awful despite the cash spent on it. Of course they'll be exposed by two high-powered defenses in the Jags &amp; Cowboys.	Can you say that again? 
Not having the other flashpoint characters isn’t really a hinderance for him, it’s more the other way around, without batman the other flashpoint characters are not nearly as good. It’s hard to overstate how good FPbats can be so that is my recommendation 	I'd say the only flashpoint card who suffers without the others is deathstroke. Guy is nearly useless without his flashpoint teammates. Even having just one makes a big difference. 
Your kitty is pretty. 	Thank you :)
Sometimes I wonder whether this is what started the darkest timeline	A perennial loser turning into a dynasty isn't the darkest timeline. That would have been something like Dwight to the Lakers working out or Lebron actually winning 6 or 7 titles in Miami.
Did Michael Bisping turn into a cat?!? Haha jk. Cute little guy you have there. 	Haha! 
I wonder if all the do-gooders knocking this woman said the same thing about Scott Brison back in the day.	Or Belinda Stronach who turned from blue to red.

Why is it so hard for managers to just say no? I mean, yeah the customer will yell and curse, but so what? That’s how you teach a brat that they can’t always get their way	The customer is always right /S Which that saying isn't even correct anymore since the whole meaning and translation of it is lost to everyone now.

What do you mean "what's the best IRA account?" If you mean "Which brokerage should I open an IRA with?" then the most popular on this sub are Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab. If you mean "Should I open a Roth or traditional IRA?" then there is an article in the wiki discussing exactly that [question](https://www.reddit.com//r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional)	OK thanks. Looks like the Roth IRA would be more effective for my needs/age/circumstances. That said, what do you think of a DIY vs manage it for me investing style? I have zero financial background 
INTJ	Can confirm.

Probably not much, xenomorphs are terrible at research - constantly drooling on their keyboards or yawning and breaking monitors with their tongues.  And heaven forbid one of them gets a paper-cut...	Every single time they contaminate the experiment by drooling on it.
I wonder what r/wow will cry about now	Except they didn't even address that they are going to fix all the issues currently in the game. They are just going to introduce more things to cause more issues with the game without fixing the problems already there.
They did say that they were increasing the drop rate a couple updates ago but I still seem to see people complaining about it, so I'd say you're quite lucky.	Yeah if that's the case then I'm even more grateful.

Question : if I don’t expect to get 5k on my engine before the heavy winter fall, should I get the oil changed prior to 5k miles as it will be garage kept during the winter ?	I'd always put fresh oil in there and drive it a bit to get it flowing through everything. Up to you if you want to change it a second time after winter too. Some people do, some people don't.

try modeling the economics of your choices. [Here's an animated illustration of the basic steps to take](http://i.imgur.com/OkKT1Tm.gif). &amp;#x200B; with that model of your choices in hand, make sure baby's &amp; mom's (dad's?) MDs are in the networks of your optimal choice.	Thanks for that animation! Helps break it down pretty easily.
In my high-school economics class they taught us not to get student loans. 	Yeah, we didn’t have economics at my school like that. We did have army recruiters and recruiters from universities begging us to come give them our money. 
This is a yuck meme	Shame on you Debbie
I got one once on Christmas and it was a bunch of letters cut out of magazines or something and pasted on to a paper that said “merry Xmas, you can’t see your family” I have always wondered if he meant to say “I’m sorry you can’t see your family” or if it was some kind of veiled threat. Step up, kid	If there was only a return address available. Letters cut out of magazines “Santa isn’t real” 
Great. Question: these contracts must intersect with the secure hardware in order to function? 	Yes, that's correct. Enigma is partnered with Intel to work together to use Intel's Software Guard Extention (SGX) hardware for the protocol. 
Kevin is the 0% stupid internet meme boy 	&gt;kevin
I don't date coworkers.	But I actually like someone of my coworkers :(
Her son is sick but every single sentence in this is about herself.	While I agree with your comment, I'm upvoting it mostly because it's sitting at 5999 karma.
Looks like a rice weevil. Check your cupboard if you have old rice in unsealed container. They also eat other grains/starchy food. Throw away food where you find the bugs and clean your cupboard with vinegar so they don't multiply.	Thank you!!
Oh boy. Those new Earl Grey boxes from Twinings are quite colorful!	Same, I don’t know what the old boxes look like since this is my first time ordering, but I just love the design of the packaging!! (The tea is delicious too 😉)
In the same vein, if you want crispy wings when you order out, ask for them in a pizza box instead of a styrofoam container.	Apple patented a takeaway pizza box that’s pretty awesome to prevent sogginess.
Is this by the Brooklyn Bridge?	Manhattan bridge.
I have goggles but I struggle with them mainly due to them fogging up. Anyone have any tips to prevent it?	I use wilson nvues. a bit expensive but they barely fog up at all for me, even in really long and intense matches. I used tecnifibre goggles before, and those fogged up really badly. other than that, yeah a headband will help
Whoa I saw that sign yesterday, this is weird as f— I mean: A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!	Just liked his for Exactly 66 likes. Order executed.

Not sure what you mean. Usually lower caliber dakka ships can get 21 citadels in a game quite easily, like minotaur.	Even in a mino it is not common to have that many broadside buffoons though :P
Try switching out the drip tip, it helped get rid of the whistling in mine. The tip that comes with it has that weird "spitback guard" as they call it.	There's no spitback guard on my NRG that I received with my Revenger X a few days ago. [Pic](https://imgur.com/a/BFBDax3) PS. In the photo I'm using my old Coolfire IV TC100 since the batteries for my Revenger haven't arrived yet.

10 team standard, Adam Thielen as WR1. Should I go with Golden Tate vs NE, Larry Fitzgerald vs Chicago, DeSean Jackson vs Pittsburgh, or Nelson Agholor vs Indiana as WR2?	I would go with DeSean or Agholor. Non PPR I probably lean the first one. I think DeSean is higher ceiling agholor is higher floor. 
I'm into it! Your aerial invert is so pretty and controlled. I'm jelly! 	Thanks that means a lot to me! Next step is aerial invert with straight legs... Also thanks for this idea it was so much fun to do! Still need to figure out how to keep spinning longer / faster in the ayesha variation
They might not even address the fall in her first episode honestly.  We all know by now that the tardis can materialize around her or whatever. 	Yep. Like "well, I exploded already. This is a random setup I picked up. Let's go back a few minutes ago and save the Doctor"

Probably dust or something in the brakes. My 15 xt is at 66666 miles and I’ve had my brakes start to squeak but after I brought it in they were good as new. I’m in Colorado and do a lot of mountain driving and I’m still on stock brakes 	It seems to be worse in damp weather I'm due for an oil change, maybe I'll spring for a full service at the dealership and have them check it out The tailgate is back to regular speed
Props for spelling it "KorY" instead of "KorI" just my preferred spelling and the original 	I agree, I was happy to see that as well 
Get some tight ends on the field, run up the middle and get a good o line that has high run block. I have all 88-89 run block o linemen on my salary cap team, ranked top 100 and I run at a 70%run 30% pass ratio, mainly only passing on on 4th downs. Everyone I face is generally 200 or lower rank, so they all of course are using the dime, dollar, nickle 335 meta defenses, and I am able to successfully run on them. Granted tie could be different for regular mut where everyone can basically have maxed out players and shed you lol. 	I was running 2TEs on field with Ricky and an 89/90/91ovr oline lol
I’m really liking the parental theme in this show. That one lady basically summed up the idea: are we versions of our parents? Are our lives just another reality of theirs? Or are we ourselves? Very cool ideas going on. 	Man I forget so much even right after watching. Which lady said this? 
I really hope the leak about Ken in smash ultimate is true, we need the *superior* shoto in smash	When I saw Reuben Langdon at a convention earlier this year, he hinted about doing some upcoming work as Ken that he couldn't talk about yet, so that could be Smash Bros.
Wow that must feel really good. Not like everyone has posted the exact same thing on this subreddit	Just because other people have done it, it shouldn't feel good? 
Metropolis	This songs amazing
The Omnibus. Ken Jennings and John Roderick talk about a different subject every Tuesday and Thursday as they try to create a time capsule for the people of the future, who vary from episode to episode.	Came here to say this one. Very entertaining! It's the only pod I listen to religiously. Great for trivia and esoterica buffs. Fascinating and funny. Hosts have terrific chemistry. 
What else have we missed? Can we see the other three?	Ya I'll post them soon. 
UH OH! RULE NINE!	for real though, no offense to OP in particular, but do people not bother checking the sidebar before posting? also, not using the screenshot function and instead taking a photo with a phone.
Is this just off the fact that both of their powers involve chains?	Yes.

Awww lovely post. It's good your reaching out. I would offer to help. But I feel I'm too young 😂	Aw thanks! If you think you have a fatherly or brotherly instinct that's all that really matters to me! 
Carn the pies!	Eagles love eating pies.
Love that they send the managers off for a week to Vegas, but I’d love even more if they put that money back into paying us more. 	Or hiring new people. been 3 short on avg for a month.
I read a report a while ago from the MTA advocating for this project and the three track extension in Nassau county as a way to make real estate out by Ronkonkoma more desirable. This would add cheaper housing to the market and ease congestion. It's interesting that they don't mention that as a reason now.	Cheaper housing? Take a look into the price for an apartment at Wyandanch these days. Maybe they meant the percentage of "affordable housing" that the developers had to construct? 
You spent your coins on tip. 	How? I’m confused

12 team, .5ppr Rivers @ rams Or Dalton @ panthers	I'm in the same boat except 10 team. I'm leaning towards rivers purely because Melvin Gordon is a mismatch nightmare in the pass game
I have to give a mention to the OBCR of *Passion*. It's a phenomenal score, sung by fantastic voices (Donna Murphy, Jere Shea, and, of course, Marin Mazzie) and the recording quality is really great. Plus, unlike a lot of book musicals where the shift between songs can be abrupt or weird, despite *Passion* having dialogue between songs, the cast album transitions seamlessly through the whole thing, feeling like a complete theatrical experience just within a single hour-long cast album. As far as musical quality and experience of listening, this cast album has to be one of my all-time favorites.	Can you give me a quick summary of what you think the plot for “Passion” is? I’m listening to it and reading about it but I still don’t get it. 
I remember skipping school on launch day... no regrets...	Same, skipped class and hit my local walmart right when it opened. 
Wanna fix the VA?  Stop making broken veterans.	It would help if the Republican party wasn't always trying to gut it. And if they didn't blame rank-and-file employees, many of whom are veterans themselves, for problems caused by higher-ups, and use that as a justification to target their union representation.
This begs the question of whether progression has been deliberately stifled so that you're more likely to spend money. I very much doubt that they built this system out, balanced it and *then* implemented microtransactions on top of it so that the core experience was not influenced.	It prompts the question. Begging a question is something different. 
Someone check to see if Mike London is on the Louisville sideline 	Bravo

So, in 2008 when we played the Pirates last week of the season, I went to Texas Roadhouse to eat because I was getting my wisdom teeth out the next day. That was the Braun walkoff slam game. I'm going there to eat tonight. I don't think I'll be able to get my teeth out again though.	I mean, there are still teeth to pull right? You could sport dentures for the brewers. 
For those that didn't watch the game, Tua had 400 yards of offense, 4 passing TDs, 1 rushing TD and he didn't even play for 3 full quarters.	enjoy it now boys,  TUA is going to be the face of college football for the next 2 years.  dude is too good.  #1 draft pick level good
I get that issue from time to time. You might notice that line is actually from the middle of the screen. It fixes itself by turning the monitor off and on again for me. 	Turning off and on does nothing. And changing resolution and changing back did nothing. S2716dg a07

"The species does tend to think very highly of itself in terms of intelligence, yet destroys its surrounding environment.

Just to confirm, if i'm holding ETH long term, and I want to buy some alts now, I can buy some more ETH now and use it to buy alts without having to pay taxes on capital gains for my long term ETH?  I mean there is no other way to buy alts.  This is for USA.  Is there a time limit on doing so?	The safe, easy thing to do would be to find a way to use something other than ETH.

Hey [**johnppr**](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnppr/)**,** Thanks for your post. I am truly sorry you came across such problem. From what I see, you have reported it to the seller, so he has to offer you a proper solution. You can get a refund or a new code/gift if he has any in the stock.

As far as I know 3 was only ever released for the PS3 and the Vita. The PS3 version did well enough, but I don't think all 3 of the Vita owners (*/s :P*) managed to push it over on that platform. So basically, nothing on the PC side right now. Though I would be interested in a solid port.	I know the Vita is not very popular, but man, I actually enjoyed the side story of Disgaea 3 on the Vita with Rutile and Stella more than the main story. Really hope 3 and 4 gets ported as well.

&gt; ...  Telltale would have to give each of the 275 employees salary and benefits for a full 60 days following their termination, if the plaintiffs win the lawsuit. The penalty is exactly the same as the legal requirement though. Suggestion for lawmakers: breaking laws should carry a **risk.** There's no risk in breaking this law, only a speculative gain (if you get away with it) or the exact cost of following the law (if you get caught). And that's assuming there's any money left to be found by the time a ruling comes down. 	That’s just the starting damages. The court could push additional punitive fines as well as require Telltale to pay the attorney and court fees for the plaintiffs, either of which could add on millions in damages. Telltale is in deep if they are found guilty.

This probably isn’t the place for it, but something that’s always confused me is: What’s the point of becoming more richer if you’re already wealthy enough to be in the top percentage of people in the world? Like at that point, what are you even going to do with all that money? You can support yourself and anyone you want for basically your lifetime. Any sign of status you could buy to show off is meaningless because everyone that you probably associate with has one as well. Sure, you could devote the funds to a cause you believe in, but to rich, you got to hoard it. But if your “hoard” is already one of the biggest around, what’s the point of making it bigger?	Wealth is the result, not the goal. I’ve found most wealthy people to be extremely energetic ambitious people. They won’t stop because they can’t. Not even necessarily because they are greedy but because they would get bored.

Giselle was the fake name she used when she ran a few restaurant cons with Jimmy in the earlier seasons. The bottle stopper that she's looking at in her office is from one of those cons, and she obviously remembered it fondly. 
Nah youre just a guy the internet market is saturated with those so thats like 80% of the people who wouldve clicked gone and then the rest is a matter of chance	Yeah ur right 
I love how they all have the exact same facial expression. Sleepy with a hint of confusion. 	Stoned. 
The lights turn off. The mind turns off.   	The scary scenario is if the mind stays on
Inb4 ‘hilarious’ move them to perth/kick them out the comp comments	manly bad lol
You have ammonia (bad), no nitrite (great, this is the worst one), and some nitrate (also good, it means bacteria is in your filter). Solution, as always, is to do frequent water changes until this goes away. Try one now!	Nitrate could easily be from the tap water, in which case this is what a crashed or uncycled tank would look like.  Test the tap water and compare.
lol rewatching Tangela reveal JC looked livid 	Is there a clip? I didn't see JC's reaction the first time
HB?	I had to took it up. But it looks like heavenly body magic.
Ergh. On one hand my team is majorly struggling and I’d love to have my second round pick in the lineup, but on the other hand I can’t help but feel like he’s staring down a 7 point performance even if active 	Same here. I can already see ppr 3 rec 10yds 10 carries 30yds, 7 points.
Top - Garen Jungle - Master Yi Mid - Annie Bot - Ashe, Miss Fortune Support - Janna edit: Warwick and Garen are good for what you want	I think Master Yi is awful for new players because he kinda stops you from learning the game
I'd like to throw in another question about the 4-game rule.  I'm guessing this isn't allowed, but could a player come back after their true senior year and play up to four games as part of a redshirt year?	No
can you buy me a lambo in 200 days?	The address is not mine, but the person is getting paid every 3 days and earning $7k p/m, i like the way this delegation service shows a clear and transparent overview of all the info.
.5 PPR Give: Fitzgerald, Burton Get: McCoy, Reed	I've had reed and he's been great for me. I dont trust Trubisky. If you're talking about Fitzgerald and not Fitzpatrick I like this trade for you. Rosen is going to play better than Bradford, but I see Kirk starting to eat into his targets.
Everyone I’m talking to thinks he is not very good and where is just going to get more work	The guy is a good RB.  Was a beast in college and a first round draft pick.  Don't think talent is the issue.  It's more of opportunity and staying healthy. 
It’s still the first thought that crosses my mind every time I hear it. It’s been said at least 30 times and still the same initial thought	Oh good I am not alone.
Do the bounties that require clanmates. Its hard sometimes but it gives almost half of what you need. Also if you complete bounties you can save them for the next week go redeem them. Edit:Spelling	I think your autocorrect has failed you lol. 
Followed. Would appreciate return follow www.twitch.tv/kingsix67	Got you man thanks for stopping in
It is still down. Over the day they are rolling out the update	Thanks :) &amp;#x200B;
Weird Fishes/Arpeggi - Radiohead 	Best song on In Rainbows
Check out Kevyn Aucoin’s contour products. They’re pricey but are great quality, perfectly cool-toned, and look amazing on pale skin of any undertone. 	Do you have the one in light? How cool-toned would you say it is? 
Uhm, kinda of a stupid question, How does the passport renewal system work? Sabi kasi sa DFA website that it will be treated as a new application pero at the same time psa birth cert lang kailangan? Thank you in advance  for the replies.	Treated as new application kasi same ng process or ng steps, less requirements lang. Kasabayan mo din mga new applicants sa pila
Why's it gotta be a muspell tho :/	that's what I'm sayinnnnnnnnngg!
But but but Removing the broble in our skools is why children are so addicted to technology now a' days ?	Not sure if sarcastic or not? Anyhow it's a nonsensical argument. The same was said when the newspaper was around. Everybody was reading that instead of talking to each other. The medium changed the results stayed the same. 
"I don't think this get can any bigger" Nice	I had one too many deathsticks and forgot to save the psd :(
Didn't WotC finally start using "they" for player pronouns on M:TG cards? I remember being a newbie magic player and thinking "Just put 'they' in your errata, it would be way easier to read!"	they did and I love it. every card now uses "they" pronouns in it's oracle text and the game seems to be adding more and more lgbtq+  characters.
Not a bug. We got them completed as a bonus in the quick fix. Just to bad the now broke entire board with the fix. Nothing counts	Please contact our player support team using the in-game support function so that we can see your account and get a better understanding of what's happening.
I love how they plugged theirself in order to make it 4 Panels	I imagined the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme started playing
That was the worst throw ever. Of all time. 	/r/unexpectedredvsblue
How will we tell if the West Midlands are ‘devastated’	Good question
what about season 1?	You always get that one
The eagles were close to this last year with Wentz Ertz Alshon but not a solid RB. Saints can also be added into this so far this year with Brees, Thomas, and Kamara.	You likely couldn't have drafted Kamara and michael thomas
FYI You can put Elder Orb (and Shaper Orbs) or other such "cant remove from your inventory" items into any crafting bench. Just be careful cus you might forget it's even there for a long time	You can drop them in a map, and it will be back in zanas quest reward.
Shut the Front door! 	Which one!?
I think this is a pretty great piece! However (this might just be me) this is kind of on the edge of the uncanny valley. You know, right before it gets weird, but it looks really cute. It might be because it looks a lot more realistic than typical furry art and the fur texture. Other than that I think it looks great!!	Ooo I hadn't thought of that! You might be right, ive only been a furry for about a month, but its been super hard to adopt my realistic art style to furry art.
Invite him over on a weekend night for dinner and a movie, ideally when you don’t have roommates around.  Get some wine and get cozy on the couch! 	I've only got weekdays right now but I can still try for a movie night. It's the "implication"
Forgive me if this is a dumb/already answered 10k times question but: do these deals translate to kroger owned stores? Like Ralph's? 	Yup. Go to [this link](https://kroger.softcoin.com/programs/kroger/freefri/) instead, and choose your store.
You ever say a word so many times it starts to sound "fake"? Basically that.	Was gonna say the word "the" but this is much better 
Depends, if Lillejeren and Sandin are good they will be fine. If they are not... It will be hard for them to build a competent defense. 	I guess but with the players they  have signed it shouldn't be too difficult assembling a few guys out of free agency. 
U on?	Nah I'm at work sadly :(
what is your southern hemisphere philosophy of choice voidist or nihilist in terms of modern day philosophies	We like tractors... 
Evander Kane- Kotkaniemi - Patrick Kane Just call them The Kokaners 	I think lehtera would work here as well.
Who or what braided his mane? Who knows. I need to practice horses more. http://imgur.com/gallery/7R9QSHr	Is that post Malone?
Huh, I always do this. Makes it so that they all go in the trash at the same time. If I throw out one or two shells the trash gets to be pretty foul rather quickly which means I have to take it out more often. But if I keep the spent shells in the fridge they do fine till trash time. 	Just take out the trash...?
You'll deal with PICNICs daily. Problem In Chair, Not In Computer. 	ID-10-T error.
What’s the opposite of this, because that’s me!	Ugh it would be nice, I *need* 11 to 12 and if I don't get that a few days in a row I start vomiting and am constantly dizzy. Worst part is that it's not part of my other sleep disorder, it's just on top of it.
He was also Shikamaru!	No wonder, he was too hype in his last life so everything's a drag now.
b EDIT: can’t believe I got 20+ upvotes for commenting a letter of the alphabet.	E
Of course it does. If they included pro life women, they may end up with opposing viewpoints. Why on earth would they want that! 	Exactly. 
What does the Urban Meyer sign say?	Doesn’t matter, it will be a lie. 
G	E
The first thing we need to clear up is, do you mean Java or JavaScript? They are two different things that have very little to do with each other.	Java Edit: just realized I’m a r/lostredditors
How low can your life get that you'd consider this a good way to spend time?	Average low.
Why? You lost probably because you were outskilled. Maybe save the replays, and look at everything you could have done better instead of sulking.	Ever crossed your mind that after every season reset there are tons of people who don't belong in the ranks they got after the placement matches and/or are still doing them?
Is OU still insanely strict about guys being in the girls dorms late at night? Serious question. 	It was only that way in the freshman dorms when I went there.   
I know there is a size range within Nice and Great throws, but is it also like that with Excellent?	Yes
i'd like to join. CP311 Magsorc. gt is Eyzol	A guild mate should send it momentarily! 
If Mourinho gets sacked before January, I will eat a bag of spiders	Wow I think he will certainly be here next week and the week after but January is a big shout, honestly if he lost the next two in a row it probably has to be the last straw. 
I still haven't found a working stream. I kinda feel like this isn't happening for me tonight.	This is good also [**https://s.ustreamix.com/stream.php?id=sky-sports-main-event&amp;token=dafe50f6f916e5f0f3d9fcaaae0d0763**](https://s.ustreamix.com/stream.php?id=sky-sports-main-event&amp;token=dafe50f6f916e5f0f3d9fcaaae0d0763)
If it comes of Barrett as he's diving and goes forward is it technically a knock on?	It came off his leg. 
Need an all or nothing contract with some time left, have 8.5q complete	I have 3d8h left and I've calculated that I can reach 1q by the end is that enough time?
How the heck did you get through?	To CS? I waited on hold for 30 minutes, twice haha 
K	K
What I really want to see is something that uses both rear cameras at the same time. Different focus points, shutter speeds or even iso could lead to some cool video advances. We could chance focus after the fact, use the higher shutter clip to analyze the stabilization and even combine different iso levels to get HDR video.	I want that now. Do you know of any 3rd party apps that does that?
Hi I do not know exactly where to save the mp3 for it to be accessible from my apple music. I have a subscription and no matter where I save the song I cannot see it in apple music. Any suggestions?	Try to check in “recent added” section
I always enjoy when scientific articles use the word dumb in them. But in all seriousness, we need to step up and step up fast to reduce that carbon footprint.	Can I send you a referral link for solar panels for your home, then?
Did you try putting sudo before the command?	What you said.
hahaha good one !!	He ain't goin out like that
They’ve already moved on to prescription pain pills. Saw a commercial yesterday where a kid was so desperate for pain killers that he broke his own hand with a hammer. 	Commercial, you serious?!
r/thanosdidnothingwrong. Used to be a ton of funny memes. Now it's pictures of purple things. Wish I had been snapped because r/intothesoulstone is the place to be for marvel memes	At first I was happy with my spared badge... Now I'm just subbed to /r/thanosdidnothingwrong.
do professional swimmers sweat when they are training under water? 	I did lifeguards up until recently. You feel tired/out of breath, etc in the pool but you never feel sweaty. As soon as I’d go in the changing rooms I’d feel boiling and my face would go red so I’d assume we just don’t notice sweating due to the water.
Tell her to commit ankle scooter 	No, commit bed frame corner
Dollhouse. Fairly poor acting but a great story line.	I'll give it a try. Thanks
How do people like this even exist ? Edit: please stop telling me this is Florida, please. 	I see something like this about once a week driving in Boston
RBNY wasn't even in their final form. 	*It rubs the lotion on its skin or it gets the hose again*
Kamara is something else.. so talented. Would do anything to trade for him 	I'm 100% positive last year that I picked him up off waivers and then promptly dropped him for Darren "FRESHLEGS" McFadden with the Zeke suspension. Yup...
