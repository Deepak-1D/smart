Read the Stay Night Visual Novel. First route is not like it was in the 2006 anime. I recommend you to read Unlimited Blade Works even if you have seen the anime to understand better Shirou.

The only thing that has made me cry in my 23 weeks so far are some relationship issues we are going through (he works nights 6 days a week, I work days, hardly to no contact some times, no intimacy and some nights its been hard to deal with).

A cool theory. Personally I don't think Ulfric knows about mantling or would pursue it; he seems more interested in tangible goals.

13/10 Good Dawgs	They're all Good Dawgs, my friend.
It'd be neat to be able to build some kind of pre-Habitat mobile spaceship that could hold pops.  It might hold a very small number of pops (somewhere like 4-8) to avoid being unbalanced, and would effectively be a planet in terms of other mechanics (like research/unity stuff). In Cherryh, it just wouldn't affect borders at all and maybe couldn't leave your borders?  Or enter another empire's borders?  In Cherryh, ship-building is already divorced from planets, so no huge deal there. You could give it -100% minerals unless it was docked around some kind of space feature, that'd be interesting. Perhaps the bigger issue here would be: why would you bother to move your planet-ships around?  Unlike BSG, you aren't on the run.	Resources?
My neurologist recommend to do some cardio before weight lifting when I had problems. Worked for me. Sounds like you're the opposite and get them with cardio? Don't ya love how consistent these are :/	Just the best! Just gotta deal I guess

both the red wine as well as the beef stock is essential for the true BB taste, IMHO. pro tip - brown the beef on only 4 of the sids each cube has, maillard is otherwise a bit too overpowering as a flavor. Use good bacon, Nueske's is great. sear the muschrooms on a hotassed pan to get a golden browning on them. reduce the liquid after the stewing so it just coats a spoon, makes for a better mouthfeel. 	Yeah nueskes. Go Wisconsin.

If you buy the Season Pass, you get all of the DLC that was released (Survival, Underground, Last Stand).	Perfect. 
I think they are balancing the science class out a bit.  The devs do not play the game in any meaningful way which is why they can't balance champs.   This is why there is a Blade and why there is a Sentry.  They don't mean to have this imbalance to this level but they are poor planners and do not play the game.  	i agree.

Suggestion: There have been several threads that have stated that the sub is too mainstream and many good but more obscure games or lesser known games are never discussed.

Bundle price doesn't change depending on how much content of it you already own (just like for cosmetic bundles). And you're not reimbursed either. So you just have to compute at this point whether it's cheaper for you to buy the bundle, or to buy separately the operators of the bundle you are missing.	that's kinda annoying
By the way you worded this "question" and your replies to comments in this thread I can tell you just want to hear people complain about others more fortunate then themselves. 	I don’t see how you got that idea.

Expect the best out of them. Walk in thinking and acting like they are mature, reasonable adults. Anything racial or bullying should be met with surprise that they would act in such a rotten way.

Did his evo upgrade?	Yes.
Two contracts and one contract are effectively the same thing. That being said, *technically* another contract will be generated, but it will appear as one contract. Where it makes a difference is when that hashpower expires. If you buy some hashpower, then you buy more later, you'll have the combined total of the two, but when a year has passed the first purchase date, you'll lose the hashpower from your first purchase, but the hashpower from for second purchase will keep going into one year from the second purchase date.	Thanks!

Don't know if this counts but back in my school days my English teacher gave the class a paper to write about something along the lines of 'technology experienced by three different generations' I can't remember the actual title now but anyway we had like 3 weeks to do it and I never did as she very rarely checked our stuff she just would randomly ask one or two people to read their one out. This time she asked me to read mine out unfortunately. So I picked up my emtpy notebook and just made up an entire paper, she said that it was really good and made a big deal about how good it was. When she found out that I actually read from a blank page she let me away with because she was impressed and I fooled her. 	You're good

I splurged and got a level 3 Dooku. I've had moderate success with him as a counter pusher at the tier 12 level, but still testing decks and play style.

Thanks for the info
Life starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds 	Second this.
&gt; Yet, still, some of my friends who I look to for advice keep telling me its value is tethered to the dollar and thus is a stable place to park your crypto. I believe people who are using tether aren't investors but day traders. Here's an example, I purchased 20 NEO couple of days ago around $100 and sold it for $140 shortly after, I received about 2800 tether. Two days ago the market dropped another 20%, I would have lost a majority of my profit if I had held ETH. As for if I trust tether, I don't fully trust them, so I'll only hold onto tether no longer than a week. Hopefully, Bitfinex can trade [some of their BTC](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r) for Tether and get tether to burns some of their coins. 	This makes a lot of sense. Thank you

My advice, get him off zero hedge asap. Is he bearish on equities, gold, bonds, all of them?

What level are they at? Are we talking about newcomers? Beginners? Intermediate? early advanced? That will help with the kind of material that is appropriate for them.

Is that a normal school day thing or something that is unique to the ELD program?	Intermediate and Early Advanced
Coherence, trying to keep up was exhausting but it was an amazing movie 	I'll have to check that out! 
I would hope this is a future update. Bluetooth Low Energy supports a signal strength (two fields for it), and while it varies with the chipset (not to mention environment), Tesla could add a Low/Medium/High type slider to unlock based on this signal strength indicator. They could keep it at it's default, but if the car monitors 3-4 "mirror unfolds" between door openings, maybe suggest a higher threshold for the signal strength value.	Brilliant.
That looks amazing. Where is this?	This is at Shiki Sushi in Kennewick, WA :)

Labour understandably preferred to seek political advantage to brand it a 'Dementia Tax', unfortunately, rather than consider its merits. 	Seeking political advantage? During an election campaign? Well I never.

The small single speaker units are not for simulating car audio at all. The short answer is: a single speaker won’t have the phase alignment issues associated with having a tweeter and low end driver. You can get a much more detailed midrange from them. Some people will use a single speaker and mix in mono on them, but that’s beside the point. U/quadsonquads got the rest of it correct. 	Awesome! Thanks for the info. :)

For what it's worth, I've done a small amount of experimenting with UB Control using Metallurgic Summonings, and have done pretty well with it. Not many decks are set up to deal with enchantments while everyone is prepared for TSG. Summonings doesn't put a 5/5 on the table the turn you cast it, but it's also never being removed by most decks and takes over the game just as hard as TSG.	Most green decks will board into Naturalize, however.
I'm guessing you kind of like Rattray's... Haha	I've heard its okayish. I might try it someday!

This is how I did my first year's worth of ruskii, all in one 8-week intensive course.  It was lots of fun because it was a good group of folks from around the country.  We literally turned pages by the second at times in our textbook.  If you don't have anything else going on (including a job) then it's the way to go for sure.  Otherwise, I would imagine it being pretty tricky to make the most out of it while having to concentrate on other things.	thanks, sounds like a lot of fun then!

Not really an infographic. Infographics should be short and concise.

Gravity actually has limits. It can only work across one Planck length (can’t remember the actual number but it’s down to the spaces between quarks) at a minimum, if no other mass is within that radius of a particle it essentially doesn’t exist. Plus there are three other primary forces as well, magnetism strong force and weak force, some of which are actually stronger than gravity, they just don’t increase exponentially the more things they affect. 	Woah woah there, slow down buddy

Stop talking about yourself so much next time.  Thats when her responses become automatic just cause shes a decent human being.  No depth.  No interest.  I say ask her to do something that friends do, that she likes, not necessarily a date because it may be too raw for her rn.  After getting to know her platonically and you still want to properly date, then be forthright and tell her thats what you want between y’all.  Dont rush things and remember to try to get her to talk about herself, ask questions! 	Take this advice! Perfect.

I'm 18 and he is 23. Even though 5-year gap might seem small, there is a significant difference in the level of maturity between us as I'm still a high school student and he is a grad one.

It wasn't ripped off, more likely you made it of non-magma-safe stone. If you use any non-magma-safe material in making your floodgate, including the mechanism to connect it to a lever I believe, it will melt once the magma is in the same tile as the floodgate (aka once you open it) and the building will be destroyed. To avoid this, use only magma-safe components. http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Magma-safe As for your runaway magma situation, I suppose you could try dumping water on it with buckets to stop the flow?	That's probably the mechanism. I will try the water thing.

Yeah, the freeway "names" never really caught on most other places.  I grew up near the Dwight D. Eisenhower Freeway and the Harold T. "Bizz" Johnson Expressway, but have never once heard anyone call either by those names.  It's just I-80 or Highway 65.  But the San Diego Freeway and Ventura Freeway, etc. were so ubiquitous here that the number just replaced the location in the name of the freeway.

What accessory exercises maximise pec activation near full contraction? During a dumbbell flye the resistive force is greatest when your arms are parallel to the floor.

I installed LED bulbs in my 2008 W211. They work great, and provide noticeably better illumination; the only issue is I had to jury-rig them. Normally in a W211 the H7 bulbs are held in with a retainer clip (this ensures proper positioning for the projector headlamp). The LED bulbs have massive heat-sinks, which don't allow the clips to fit. Duct tape works wonders. All that said, check and see if the W204 has projector lamps. If so, their illumination could be bad because the bulbs are loose. Image search to see what I mean.	Thank you for the insight!

I forget if this was at state or a BOA regional, but during my freshman year of high school someone in our drumline decided to bring a couple cookies with him onto the field. During one of their slower parts, the guy pulled them out and asked the rest of the drumline if they wanted some. The lead snare started cussing him out... within earshot of one of the field judges. We heard it on the tape that week. Our director was not pleased. Fortunately no one in the box could see or hear anything so it didn't cost us too much.	Should have offered the field judge a cookie

You’re asking for the internet to be essentially censored. Like most of the people here hold unpopular opinions.

Welcome brother. Disregard females, acquire currency.	That's the plan!
Yes, the pressure increases and decreases. The function for liquid pressure is `density * gravity * depth` You can change the gravity by the "force" pushing the water against the bottom of the bucket. When you compute the pressure you can see that when the bucket is on the bottom the pressure is bigger than if it was still. If the bucket is on top of the loop the pressure can be lower or greater accordingly to the speed you spin it around. The air has a different formula but still has an acceleration component so the pressure still changes in a similar way. A vacuum would be created if you spin the bucket fast enough. But I can't really imagine how the pressure would behave from a still bucket until the vacuum was formed. 	Thanks for your answer!

Worked harder in college. I had plenty of fun and did well enough to be reasonably successful but I’m not living up to my potential and expectations for myself and now the things I want to do are limited by a transcript with enough blemishes to hold me back.

Lol, there is good and bad to both, just depends on what that machine needs. Back in the day power supplies and HDD (and everything else really) were still in their infancy.  HDD hibernation was not much of a thing, same with the OS going to sleep, etc. So to save wear and tear on parts it was standard to always turn off s computer not in use. Talking late 80s through mid-to-late 90s. As the quality of hardware has improved there is no NEED to turn computers off anymore, besides it being the first step in troubleshooting any Windows problem. As an IT guy I don't want computers turned off all.  Automated tasks run at night.	Ok ty

All kinds of cv could fall into this same category of being a sort of 'autopilot' and it would be impossible to play a modular without it.

It's called *distancing*, and is considered an adaptive strategy for emotional self-regulation. &gt;Distancing, an example of cognitive change, involves taking on an independent, third-person perspective when evaluating an emotional event. Distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self-reflection, facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli, reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli, and increasing problem-solving behavior.	This sounds like me.
Anybody know who’s after them? With there being a pretty good chance Big Ben is done after next year this might not be the case for long.	Brady to Edelman is longer than Ben+Brown
This year's championship looks very entertaining! I wonder who will end up being promoted. 	Spoiler: Wolves.

&gt;Is this all a good enough reason for them to refund my pledge? Sure it is because it's touted as a simulator....the BDSSE. Does your life run in 9 FPS? Probably not. You should expect the same of the best simulator out there on the planet. Now, answers to your questions... - Screenshots of your hangar are perfect. They are just records. Also grab a screenshot of your  billing page with ID# - Disregard #2. You have a digital purchase. You can refund the entire $45 package. It's not a subscription. 	Thank you.

I thought it was months 2-6? Only seeing 2-4 there. Is it in effect today? If so, it's not terrible actually. Not quite XIV, but it's close to mirroring VXX. Maybe like a .75 SVXY. I should probably do the math to see how it compares to XIV.	You should.

THANKS MODS!!!! YOU DID A GREAT JOB. A bit of feedback: too many lizards not enough cabbage.	Also, thanks for stomping on unecessary thing.
Gonna answer the second question, getting comfortable with keeb+mouse didn't take me long, but getting good with it definitely did. That being said, my definition of good has increased dramatically since switching, so I was probably matching myself on controller within a few weeks. My advice is jumping in the deep end and playing something that requires mastering Keeb+mouse. You might be awful at... UT or CSGO for example, but it'll make everything else seem way better.	Ok, thanks for the input

Your's look lighter than store bought. The heavier weight led packs tend to jump off after a few tree hits. My local course's 2-8 are like the heavier wood portion of WACO charity open yesterday (Brazos East, I think).  So a few tree hits in the dark are near guaranteed. -5C or 23F isn't very cold yet.  My problems are down a bit colder.	3g totally weight including the tape

We have demerit points for that reason. Every fully qualified driver has 12, regardless of means. So while the fine might not hurt the wealthy driver as much as the less wealthy driver, the points all have the same value. Once you've got 12 demerits it's bye-bye license. 	At that point, why even bother having the financial punishment? 
And people still question his pen. He’s gonna go down as one of the greats of our generation just wait on it.	Indeed he will.

Other people have added great details so I’ll just say that Sydney’s weather is similar to Southern California, even in mid winter it’s rarely below 15C /60F during the day because of the ocean influence though at night it can sometimes get below 10C.	Good to know! Thanks!

I feel as if this time instead of criticizing the post-modern ideal of everyone is a winner this second film might be a criticism of the absence of gender that has lead to a whole host of problems. However it could take the other side and instead will suggest that the gender roles aren't important or even real. Nonetheless I think it will definitely be about gender roles.	Uh oh
Love the idea, but maybe tell a bit more about yourself so people can get sort of a better picture :) 	Thanks. I updated the post.

OJ Mayo (former NBA player) was regarded as the #1 (or one of the top) HS Basketball recruits in the country. He ended up attending this tiny little Cincinnati high school for a brief period. He was quite the cocky kid. I remember he would dunk in warmups, which resulted in technical fouls, and then start each game giving up two technical fouls because he didn't care and the coach didn't have the courage to bench him.	Wait, dunking during warmups resulted in techs?

Watching cartoons. Each one was another amazing adventure which seemed completely unpredictable. As I grew older, the storylines became predictable and very much the same, and even the characters and animation seemed awful.	Sorry but ATLA remains legendary in both storyline and animation.

But if you absolutely want to use pgp, use gpa to encrypt your messages, and just copy / paste them into your current email system. It's best to encrypt while offline which was more common in the era in which pgp was developed. It's the safest way to do it. Any other way has potential to be compromised.	Yes I agree. 
Why was the REQ PwC thread deleted?	New rules
3gun local on Sat:  7th Practical @75.59%.  Had some really good runs, and I was in the running to win it with overall times, but a single small mistake on each stage hurt my finish.  Tiny things really add up in 3gun. USPSA local on Sun:  2nd PCC @99.14%.  This one came down to a dumb stage plan on one stage that obviously took me longer to run than the "correct" one.  Not sure how I talked myself into that one.	Can't wait to run my pcc next season

&gt; 1/nlog3 will go towards 0. This is true, but I don't see how, from this, you deduced that their sum must converge. For instance, the sum 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + ... has its individual terms going to zero, but the sum diverges. For any number you care to name, I can show you a portion of the sum that's greater than that number.	So what can i do instead?

I agree with this. I've always thought the easiest way to beat someone is to tilt them as soon as you can. Once they're tilted, a player likely won't be on their top game. I don't wanna be calling out anyone, but there's a particular player that is well known that is incredibly easy to tilt and it shows whenever he starts to lose. Not going to name any names, you know who it is. Otherwise he is a fine player, he just needs to stop getting so tilted.	Okay, now I'm curious, who *are* you talking about? 
Sorry for 1.5x speed lol	It's like Alvin and the Chipmunks dubbed over your video.

Key on, key off, repeat 4 times but leave it on. Your check engine light should blink out your codes. 5-5 is end of codes.

I always do it, but i also always start the game at lvl 3 or 5 so things don't really get thrown off too much like a sharpshooter at lvl 1. Some are just strait power upgrades but a lot are so needed for playing off meta that i think you end up with more variety overall.	This. And it makes for more interesting combinations.

Heard back for NTU scholarship for business + accountancy on 27 march!! As for the "chillax cfm get in or not" tbh im not that sure i'm leaning towards its not a sure get thing, mostly because so many people were offered already. Given that they offer scholarships evenly for each faculty, &amp; from hearing that many biz + computing people already got their scholarship, it could mean lesser chance for the rest. They probably would schedule the "sure get" interviews first is my take. Though of course this is my own analysis. Either way just do your best for the interview &amp; treat it seriously :-) All the best!!	What’s your RP?

We use barefoot in Angier, and really the price depends on the point of the growing season we're in. It's still early now with this ridiculous weather. I would suggest you go to the state farmers market, talk to a few sellers (there is an Asian lady with a hat that always hooks me up) but these ppl are like reps for the nurseries. Tell them what you're looking to pay and that you need a bunch, and that's how we ended up getting the # for the guy who runs barefoot. We called and went down when he said he would be in the field and paid a ton less than what they sell at the market for. So being able to go to the actual nursery is a big plus if you need quite a bit of plants. Hope that helps!	That asian lady with the hat is pretty awesome!
ughhhh I'm stumped.	The reference is 14 years old.
One of my best friends got off the waitlist at HLS last year and another friend got into Columbia. Edit: HLS acceptance came in May and I think the CLS one was also May. 	Did he do anything special on the HLS waitlist?

As far as I know it does not really matter. The only difference is a higher insulin spike if you eat late. But the carbs should be used after 12 hours non the less. I myself am a 24/OMAD late night feeder and it works well :)	Awesome! Thanks for speaking up!

When this appears, hold down the digital crown for a few seconds to Force Close the app. This resolved the issue for me. 	Tried both ways, no fix yet.

Well the game is not 100% skill, but in the long run skill &gt; luck, hence why longer matches 11+ points are more popular. Would i win rolling all 1s n 2s vs your 5s? Well no.

I never shared this with anyone but I specifically remember as a child (maybe 5 or 6) swimming in my neighbor's pool. I was under water when I had the sudden urge to breathe and it's like something took over and breathed for me...if that makes any sense. Like, I knew I couldn't breathe in water but a reflex or something made me take a breath and I actually was breathing under water...it was weird and I remember coming up out of the water wondering what just happened. I never said anything and as the years went by I think I convinced myself that I must have breathed in an air bubble or something. This is the first time I've ever acknowledged that it actually happened.	Turns out, you're not alone.  *We're all mad here.*

I used it for the first time a few days ago and I am impressed.  https://sdi-tool.org/ Best thing to do about that other tool, if you're concerned about it possibly installing something you didn't want, is look in Programs and Features in the control panel and sort by date of install.  Look for stuff recently installed that you don't want and remove it.	I'll give it a bash, is it an updater?

i like the independence that my dog has, she runs freely with me off leash for 5 to 10 mile runs, she wanders off on hikes, still looks back and waits to see or hear us before moving on too far but i love that she feels confident enough to do all this as she wasnt like that when we rescued her. it seems the more we trust her the more confident she becomes, we do get the best of both worlds as when at home she loves cuddling up under the covers with us and she is now the last to leave the bed every morning. 	She sounds like a super awesome loving dog :'^)

For me it is my favorite couple of the 3 in the VN, the main reason is because I felt sorry for Sakura. I do not want to say any spoiler to anyone, but I think Sakura deserves to be happy after everything she suffered. and Shirou is the only one who can protect and sacrifice for her, I also love Saber and Rin, but they are strong enough, but Sakura is very weak and has suffered a lot, she has to be happy. Also I think Hollow Ataraxia add a lot of good stuff to this couple. 	Thanks for comment. Also, thats a pretty cool username

I have been Keto since February and I do Crossfit 5 days a week. Don't trust the scale... I dropped another pant size but my scale still hovers in a 5lb range. Also, I use one of those BMI scales so I only step on to track my body fat and muscle percentages. I'm sure it isn't perfectly accurate but it seems to be a better indicator than my actual weight. Stay strong!	Thank you

When i don't dissociate, we talk about something important, and I feel the emotions of it. Even if only for 30 seconds. My therapist and I have a different definition.

i was actually thinking about this kind of system at some time as well (and i actually wrote out some calculations _and_ code), but if you wanted to make this into any kind of realtime system, it would be ridiculously hard. when someone sets a score, it changes the uniqueness of everyone else's scores, which in then affects the value of the score again, so it would probably require tons of systems of equations to come up with a good value for it. i'm not really that interested in data science myself, but it's a good idea to expand on. good luck	exactly it's my biggest concern

The confusion you are having stems from the fact that there are two different types of fiber - soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber firms up your stool, and insoluble fiber gets things moving.

Use them for non-food things. Crafts, paint, sandbox toys, or plant some seeds and then you can see the roots when it grows. Don’t keep using them for food.

From what i understand, you played the game on one account and want to continue playing it on the same account (which is different from the one you “bought” the game on), correct?

Considering he was robbing a convenience store the first time we saw him, I'd say he is more of a villain.

If you want to know how that can be justified, play galactic civilizations 3; their description of a sensor-related resource has something to do with particles vibrating in higher dimensions, I think. Possibly something to do.with quantum entanglement. I can't really remember because I haven't played in a while but the point is that increased sensor range can be justified in the lore.	Zro increases sensor range already.

The choice he refers to is allowing yourself to believe a reality where nothing can ever be done to change your situation. Physical slavery wasn't a choice. Mental slavery was. That's his point.

A part is biological. Female animals are the ones picking mates. It's the males getting the attention of females. This is because while a male could potentially go from mate to mate reproducing as much as possible, the female has to carry the pregnancy, lay the eggs, take care of the youngs and can't really mate again until that process is over. That limits the amount of offspring produced by her so she has to make every one count.	yeah but not everyone wants kids

Not sure why you’re “annoyed,” just don’t support it.

Source comic: https://xkcd.com/1826/ Nothing complicated. The user Spyduck put each panel behind a web door giving it a nice diorama effect as you move left to right.

You can't take a 20 on a knowledge check. Since it assumes 20 failures or something like that, the first failure on a knowledge check means you don't know because, without access to a library spell or class feature that lets you retry knowledge checks, you can't. In fact, that's the point of the Bard's fifth level class ability where once a day they can take a 20 for a knowledge check. 	Funny it’s literally a bard who keeps failing. 
What chin? 	exactly

I love ABBA.	My mom will love you.
I agree with everyone else.  A guy puts way more effort in when he is trying to win you.  Once he feels comfortable with you and the relationship, he backs off some.  He starts to pay attention to the things he neglected when he was only focused on you in the beginning.  It does feel weird at first, but it is a good sign!	That’s really reassuring, thank you!

They're not specially made for "Eastern feet", you're just picking narrow brands, e.g. Puma. New Balance, Asics are made for  "duckfeet" people like you and I. The'yre much wider in the front which will help.

While it may not be to everyone's taste, the hairstyle fits you just fine.

If the mission calls for the default version of the character on a map as a requirement, you can run it with a costumed version, but not vice versa. If an in-map gate has a *specific* character portrait, then you must use that exact version of the character.  It would be nice if they were more interchangeable, but that's how it's been for a while.	No dice...

Just started reading it today, very good.  This comic will probably develop into one of my favorites I think.	Thank you! I'm glad you are enjoying it! :D
I think this could be awesome and tie the series completely together in a good way if done right and opens alot of doors for the future. Im assuming this saga/plot will be based right after or before eoz and tackle all the other non canon storylines the movies, gt, trunks timeline etc. This could reveal that some of the villains of gt might be in the dbz/super universe and this could be a chance to have them done right or done different.	It after ToP.

I've seen someone pop their shoulder blades in and out of their socket while struggling with a restraint at work. Had to have the cops get involved and even then it was ridiculous. I have also seen people swallow metal objects like it was candy. Psych is a fun job sometimes....	Lawd! I bet.

Haven't thrown the P3 but Discmania's C-Line is usually the most overstable plastic in the line-up. (It's Innova's Champion plastic; D-Line is DX.) Edit: What's with the downvotes? Did I say something wrong? Edit 2: It turned around. Cool! I'm still a bit confused about why at least 3 people found it downvote-worthy but I guess C-Line being the most overstable is just offensive to some people. XD	Idk, you are correct.

Ticketmaster currently lists prices ranging from $300-$600 for the two DC shows. These are prices from partners of Ticketmaster. Do you think it will stay like this, or, more likely, will the other tix become available at the usual cost range ($100-$250)?	Tickets will be available at the original price points.
It's not the worst, but not super good either. You need more focus on your face/shoulder area and can crop out most of your body as it draws away focus from you. It's understandable if you can't get professional photos done, however, I'd suggest finding someone who has a nice camera and has some experience taking photos. A friend of a friend might be a budding photographer trying to get more experience. They're usually the people who do senior photos for kids in HS. Ask around and see what's out there! 	Thank you. I will keep this in mind

Just get something very close from a swatch and paint the whole entire wall. Corner to corner. No Matter how good a match is you will always see it. New paint will discolor at a dissimilar rate than the surrounding original. 	That’s probably a good idea. Thank you.

The 260s are also great fun, but make sure the intercoolers have been pressure tested/ replaced if necessary as they were a problem area and can cause major engine damage. Give me a message if you want any more info or a pre purchase inspection.	Thanks mate much appreciated, are you Auckland based?

The new grab is ridiculous. You can literally run to the left or right now and the grab will completely miss you. I’ve seen counselors run circles around Jason’s who were only using grabs 	And people say the grab is fine. XD

Keep saying this, but if Thibs gets bounced out of Minny don’t sleep on Jimmy Butler Minnesota is capped out and potentially a tax team right now, which is not a good place to be given they should be building to contend 3-years from now after GSW (presumably) breaks up. It makes sense for them to try and ‘undue’ the Butler trade when you look at the whole picture (salary cap/taxes, realistic window of being a contender, age, etc)	Wouldn't they want to move Wiggins before Butler though?

**Verdasco ML** (-120) **3u** &amp;nbsp; Not saying Andreozzi can’t win this but I feel that Verdasco should be around -150 or something. Andreozzi played his first ever five set match last round and I’m not sure how well he’ll recover. Verdasco does multiple 5 setters in his sleep it seems at majors. Last round he made an incredible amount of unforced errors which is just not likely to happen again. (And I believe this is why the line was made so close). Verdasco will be drilling his forehand to Andreozzi’s backhand and I just think this match shouldn’t be a pickem.	Appreciate the pick. Made good money on this.
does all the change from 3.3 applied to standard too ?	Yep, other than the league mechanics themselves.

Floor Coverings International of Lexington, KY. They are actually south of Lexington towards Nicholasville. We tore out nearly all of the flooring in our old house after we moved and replaced it for resale value. The flooring was mostly original carpet that badly needed replaced. Jonathan, the owner of the franchise I believe, was very thorough showing us the options available to us and pricing various different options. I was impressed he didn’t try to up-sell us, knowing we were going to be moving out. The job ran into some unforeseen problems during installation but we were always kept in the loop and the finished product looked great. The extra work ended up being a bit more than the estimate but Jonathan stuck to his original estimate. I would definitely recommend them.	How long did the work take?
INTP (possible INFP) - compliments about intelligence. But what really means the most to me is when people ask me questions about my knowledge. For example, when a coworker asks me to explain something to them or show them something, it means more than words because it means they actually trust my knowledge.	As an INFP I agree with this (:
He's in much better shape than most 70+ year olds I meet. The poorer you are, the worse shape you're in at that age. So he's had excellent medical care and generally let a materially carefree life, which does wonders for aging. That said, there are people his age and beyond who are absurdly smart and have incredible, well-honed intellectual capabilities that put him to shame. I think the idea that he may be syphilitic is hyperbolic or absurd but he probably would have done well to pursue some hobbies or eaten better. Whatever, he lives in a bubble now. I'm struggling to say something meaningful here. It's bizarre, every day, that this guy is the president. But it's also so perfect and fitting.	Hes probably got dementia

Didn't mean to break my fast so early. Was gonna try to make until lunch tomorrow but I had this super intense craving for salmon. Probably in my head since the doc said I need better HDL and it would help. At any rate I broke and bought some and marinated in citrus and soy.  Craving fulfilled, and can now get on with my day. Not the worst thing I could've eaten at least. 	It happens...

Bear in mind any answer will vary quite a bit depending on stuff like wind conditions, what clothes you're wearing and what accessories you have on the bike (that can increase wind resistance), what tires you're running and the kind of surface you're riding on. Unless you're riding laps round an indoor velodrome you can only guess a ballpark value	I plan on buying some schwalbe marathon tires. 
It is the aria (quite sliced)  "Scherza, Infida" from Händel's "Ariodante,"  sung by the countertenor Philippe Jaroussky.	wow, you know your music.
Yeah but is it better than Cavana?	of course not
Simply comparing two cars side by side is not a proper way to compare the cars, since we don't know what the designers were aiming for. We also don't know how the aero works, or, maybe having a more "Bulging" sidepod helps in some other area. Without knowing all the design decisions and the tradeoff's  it's not really possible to compare them.	OwO what’s this

You can manually change the FPS cap to any desired amount. To do so you must find your SMITE config folder: &gt; Default: Documents -&gt; My Games -&gt; Smite -&gt; BattleGame -&gt; Config There you open **BattleEngine.ini** with an editor, such as notepad (I recommend notepad++ for such things (*freeware to download*)) Search for MaxSmoothedFrameRate (about 1/3 into the document). This is default at &gt;MaxSmoothedFrameRate=150.000000 Change the number to any amount of desired max framerate  and hit save. Disclaimer: This file can go back to default settings after a patch, but can be changed at any point. Also changing the config files manually is done at your own risk. Hi-Rez does not recommend doing so. *however, based on personal experience this particular change does not create issues other then increase/decrease performance based on your hardware.*	thanks fam

I WISH they had proximity chat in this game. Say what you will about toxicity, it's totally worth it for the funny moments. Everytime you're in a build fight and both player lose each other it would be so funny. 	The mind games. “I’m above you!” “No you’re not”

I went back and rewatched the video again and noticed before the encapsulation, there was a technician working on the rear wheel well with the tires off. My theory is that they might have taken off the tires for some work and that encapsulation that you see in the video was some sort of a test fit because the struts for the cameras were still not installed in the video.	The struts appeared to me to be installed
I absolutely loved the book Coming Home by Rosamund Pilcher 	Hmmm, not my normal style but looks promising!
Just so you know, in some cases the fitting the squib threads into also holds the disk in place. I have a frangible disk on my night stand because I didn't  to see the fitting turning as I was taking out the squib.	Good to keep in mind.

You may consider splitting into two groups, then recombine if 1 or 2 people quit. 	Thank you!
Having good thrusters and a power distributor that can boost is always worth it. I still get 54ly range in my AspX with G5 dirty drives and boost speed over 500m/s.

First of all, good for you for talking to a professional and making you a priority in your busy life. I think you will find the answers you seek about what you want that way, and I hope you will get interesting perspectives for you to think on in this thread. Relationships can give you much happiness but cost in time and resources that could go to other worthy endeavors. I think if you can go without, and focus on family and work, that would be better. If you can find a someone who is willing to work hard for you and your children, then go for it. Just my two cents, good luck, mama! 	Thank you.

I've been using the Sennheiser HD-25 for years now and they still do the job perfectly. They are incredibly durable and they have the most pleasant 'flat' sound I've ever heard with headphones. They don't sound "amazing" or anything, but that's exactly what I love about them. They are very neutral; not colorizing the sound in any noticeable way. They've got a great frequency range, very clear highs and deep bass response (I'm able to hear slightly lower than 30 Hz with them). I've also noticed how detailed they sound compared to other headphones, making them very suitable for sound design and detailed mixing. So if you're going for an uncolored, neutral and fair sound, I highly recommend the HD-25. They are on-ears though, which is not everybody's cup of tea, but you'll get used to it. They're around €150, which is well worth the price.	cool, ill have a look!

I don't really care if the roll is in 2 and 3 or not.  But: * Spyro can't swim in the first game, he learns to swim in the second, and always knew how to swim in the third.  (Similarly with wall climbing, head bash, and laser eyes.) * L1+R1+L2+R2 in Spyro 2 is gem-dar, and always works; you have to earn it with a Sparx level in 3, and the powerup doesn't exist at all in 1. So Spyro is *already* different in the three games.	Spyro doesn't swim in reignited trilogy (Spyro 1)

I've heard they're both great profs, I don't think you could do too wrong with either. See what fits with your schedule better, and once school starts you can try out both lectures and attend the one you like more.	Thanks! Great idea :)
Not to sound condescending but if I had 50k on a Trezor I would have checked the seed 10 times before I did the update. I would also have checked the written down seed words 10 times before I moved any funds to it. When it comes to technology people remains the weak link.	This should be the top post.

Rising wages and rising prices *are* what has happened over a very long period of time. Bread, gasoline, milk, clothes... all have risen in absolute cost over the years. Wages have also risen over those years. I get a raise every year. Part of that raise is not actually a raise, but just a "cost of living adjustment" to compensate for the fact that over the past year prices have also risen. This is a normal, natural, and economically healthy state of affairs.	So you’re saying this is basically what we do?

Many people have done this, but personally I've always understood it to read as all the consonants of a letter group followed by the attached vowels, regardless of thickness. Otherwise, you could technically have a thin vowel attached to a thicker consonant and read it v-c.	Alright. Thanks

what i actually want - and maybe this exists and i just don't know about it - is to be able to combine search terms as a filter, so gyarados+@waterfall would return only my waterfall gyarados, rather than all gyarados and all other things that know waterfall...	gyarados&amp;@waterfall is what you're looking for.
Definitely yes. I am bad at micro. So I focused on improving vision, map awareness and macro decisions. I mained only Champs that go well with focusing above game fundamentals. Ashe, Janna and tahm kench. Generally you want kits that have vision control, globals and disengage. The climb from silver v to gold was actually pretty good in both flex and solo q that way. You sure do lose games by misplacing your ults when crucial but you make that up with superior macro game. My winrate was only like 54% on average but enough to climb there within span of 50 games in each ladder. Hope this will inspire you 	Thanks for the comment! I'll keep this in mind.
Sold two bags to my boss and then turned around and bought three more. I have a problem.	So cool you and your boss is that tight!

Yes you can work on ornaments during victory week. But once victory week ends you’ll no longer be able to work on them until the next rally.

It sounds like she's into you, yes. My only advice is that when you ask about going on a date, set a specific day and a general time \- don't leave it up to "how about next week, I'll let you know" because then when the next week arrives and there's no set day/time it's easy to punt for the next week. Girls like when guys show some decision\-making initiative.	Amen to that.

It might be because during straining you are breaking the liquid up into super fine droplets (especially if you use cheesecloth). By doing so you are giving an opportunity for all the CO2 you have built up to escape. Others have valid solutions of using juice instead. I am going to try on my next batch creating a "wort-like" juice by boiling and mashing my fruit with some water then straining that into the bottle. This way I get the flavor concentrate and none of the pulp, so no straining needed. (Hopefully)	What do you mean by "using ice instead"?

When you download a RICO asset, it comes bundled with an .xml or .txt (sometimes a .simple) file that stores the RICO values. If that file isn't present in the same directory as the asset file, the mod will ignore it. So, the easiest way leave everything intact would be to make a local copy of it. Just take the asset file, usually a .crp, and copy it into your local asset folder. Steam assets can be found in steam/steamapps/workshop/content/. Easiest way to quickly locate them is to do a search by the Workshop ID number. Don't delete the RICO file in the Steam folder that contains the asset. Steam would probably just re-download it as an update, but it's probably best to leave those items alone and turn off the Steam asset in your content manager.	I'll do

I wouldn't hesitate to share anything I've drafted with another teacher.  I've been in the position where I started a new job with zero (yes, zero) curriculum/lesson planning and really appreciated those who shared syllabi, etc. with me.  I'm a public servant (I teach in public school) and any materials I create are, in my mind, not simply for students who happen to be enrolled in my classes.   A school is supposed to run efficiently.  Hoarding resources is, in my opinion, inefficient.  I get that it feels like some teachers are free-riding, but should their students suffer for that?  	I agree.

&gt; Northon went on to say his client is a longtime "pillar of the local community" who donates to numerous charities and that he "provides good jobs to more than 30 people, many of whom have worked for him for decades."

It really depends what you're trying to achieve and what platform you're trying to achieve it on. C++ can be used to create embedded programs with no UI, or can be used to create a Windows, or Linux program with a UI, among others. With C++ the code required to build a UI depends on which of those platforms you're targeting, since the portable C++ language doesn't really provide any UI framework of its own. For Windows you might want to research Win32 UI development. For Linux you might want to check out tutorials for building a UI using GTK+.	Thank you so much~! This is really helpful

If they implement this system the same way as they do in SMITE (Chris did say in the OB68 patch preview show that the system was taken from SMITE, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbHYV8nnhnM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=32m59s), then it's the highest rank you ended a split on during the entire season. Here's a post explaning how it works on SMITE: https://hirezajax.tumblr.com/post/164297641068/how-will-the-season-4-ranked-loading-frame-rewards *For example, if you reached masters Conquest in S4 Spring split, then fell to diamond before it ended, then went platinum in summer and platinum in fall you will receive a Diamond Conquest Loading Frame. Your best split ending was Spring, with diamond.* I assume it'll work the same for Paladins.	Thank you so much!

1. Yes, a lot of times if you bring proof that you took care of the insurance issue immediately or proof that you were in fact insured at the time but just couldn't produce proof of that, then the fines can be reduced or dismissed and you'll just pay some court costs or some such thing. 2. This would likely be jurisdiction/court-specific.  You're on the right track: call the court as soon as possible and inquire about your options. 3. Yes, more often than not, with simple traffic tickets, you can handle it on your own.  Inexpensive traffic attorneys are even better at getting the best possible outcome for you, many times without you having to show up to court at all.	Thank you!
Do some people in like an official setting like a school or a job interview not take your name seriously and think you are making a joke?	Yes, all the time.

You can do it, you just won't hear yourself. "Full Duplex" in the context of an HT means you can hear while transmitting. The diplexer included with the arrow will split 2m frequencies onto the 2m side of the arrow, and the 70cm frequencies onto the 70cm side (and similarly, combine them into one line for the radio). You can either not listen to yourself, which makes it hard, or use a second HT on the RX side without the diplexer in line with the antenna. The lack of full duplex is why I went with the D72 over the D74. Both are nice radios, though.	How does the duplexing help?

Practically anyone could 'theoretically' do a better job than May, but when you're faced with an entire spectrum of MPs from die-hard Remainer hold-outs to next-level Rule Britannia Brexiteers, and an EU bent on making an example out of an intentionally messy exit, of course its going to be a blundering train-wreck.	Keep EU out of that, please.

In my life, I've always heard from philosophers and other thinkers that, you already know everything, and how you are the universe and the universe is everything. So in your dream, I guess your intuition took over, and you just knew, about all people, all things, places, everything. You were it all, but experiencing life in another situation. ("you are the universe experiencing its self one at a time" ive heard this a lot) I've also heard of DMT/ and other psychs, that give you this feeling/experience (of being and knowing all things/intuition/stuff like that) and so it's highly likely that the DMT that is supposedly produced in your brain gave you this same experience. 	Cool

&gt;NOW yes, it’s very much my fault for driving late on a permit but confusion in the laws and just moving to a new state in general just makes things worse atop of not knowing the difference between a permit and a learners "Ignorantia juris non excusat". /r/insurance can answer your insurance questions. Without a state or if you were actually cited makes it impossible to answer your other question. 	Thank you for the help, wasn’t sure where to post. 
I'm at 182lbs this week, and half a year to possible abdominal surgery. I need to drop weight and build up my abs for better post surgery recovery. More tasty salads, more fruit as snacks, and all the tea. I can do this. I can do this. 	You CAN! do this!

Ah it's unfortunate they took out mandatory max rank max gear haters, you could have tested it on floor 1 and only paid 5k. If you don't have payback it might be cool to have for the pale wind fight? I always try to think of uses for the 'set' decals, this one would be okay on defense, but I think it might make fighting PW with the shovel viable, would you mind testing it (if/when your shovel is maxxed)?	I would be happy to!

119’17.0 = 119. 17/32 or 119.53125 They are quoted in “32nd’s” Good explanations here https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/us-treasury/10-year-us-treasury-note_contract_specifications.html and here https://www.danielstrading.com/education/markets/interest-rates-financials/t-note-futures The bonds vary in tick size.

TLDR: Renault are planning on introducing a spec C variant of ICE at Spa. Currently switching the spec-B to another Spec-B would mean additional penalties, later on from Renault's perspective. Alternative interpretation: They don't have spare ICEs available and want all teams to wait until Spa for the final ICE revision of the year.	That makes sense for me.

I was working at a grocery store and one of the girls from another department would always say hi to me. We were friendly but i never really gave it much thought, until one day she came to work with her hair down. She always wore it up, but as soon as i saw her with her hair down i fell in love instantly. I asked her out to eat that same day and we had a great time. We've been dating for almost two years now and we're trying to get a place together. Im so in love with her &lt;3	That‘s a great way to fall in love.

I saw this posted earlier.  A lot of comments held the sentiment that the article is taking his quote out of context, that he meant the e-sports comment in regards to MTG.  Frankly, even though it's a little unclear, given that he said that D&amp;D is doing so well because it's an intimate, face to face type of game, I think I agree with the other commenters. 	Ah, I didn't see it. I'll remove the post then.

I don't mean to interrupt the ongoing, never ending, KD hatefest that is r/NBA, but I would like to point out just 1 minor tidbit of information. KD won that competition.  They even took one of his points away and he still won.  KD aside, if you have 15 minutes to watch the whole thing it's really great as you almost never get to see this type of stuff with some of the best talent in the league.	And it's also clearly a foul. 
No, I don't think so. The computer was already set up. Still, it wouldn't do you any harm to remember it.	Ok, will do.
When I watched it the first time I would just pick and choose the episodes that looked interesting to me. I never had a problem figuring out what was going on. Maybe stick with one season at a time watching the eps that look interesting to you and then moving on to the next season. There no reason why you can't go back and watch the eps you skipped later on. There's no "right way" to watch a tv show. Do it however you want to.	Exactly my thoughts, which season was your personal favorite?

Most cargo ships today have two-word names.  This is because all the one-word names were taken a long time ago.  Allistair Reynolds extrapolated this into the future so that his ships have names that are entire sentences. Formats for multi-word names typically have the company name followed by the name of a woman (most often) in the family that owns the shipping line, or the name of a city, country, or geographical feature such as the name of an ocean or continent. Following this convention, it's plausible that interstellar cargo ships would include the names of stars, constellations, nebulae, or galaxies. If the cargo ship is independently owned by the captain, it may have a name that deliberately goes against convention. It would likely be something personal to the captain such as a former love or his/her birthplace.    	Let's be honest they're gonna be memes

For a new player in this day and age, knowing that you can get a free Ike, Fjorm, and Brave Lyn, i think the best thing you can get to round out this team is a non-infantry green that does magic damage. Flying Nino would probably be the best choice, then Male Grima (Dragon Robin), then Green Olwen. The closes thing that will soon be readily available will be Green Lilina in the Legendary banner, so i would aim for that.	so the legendary ones coming up are not worth it?

Many areas make old fashions differently but the best in my opinion is: -Muddled orange slice and 2 cherries(muddling of the fruit is key) -3-5 dashes is bitters -Sugar cube -whiskey or brandy of your choice -lemon lime soda of your choice	I thought Old Fashions use Rye specifically
SITS is a nice departure from the norm, Ember is like a rawer Ascendancy, VF has a few good songs but you're not missing too much, In Waves is pretty good, and The Crusade is an underrated gem that would've been received way better had it come out a year later and with a more focused track listing (Anthem, Sadness, Contempt, and The Rising could've been thrown out and Vengeance and Broken One should've been there from the start). The Crusade is probably my favorite of those five nonetheless.	Thank you for your suggestions!

In our workgroup 8 l of water and 2.5 l of *i*PrOH are mixed, in a large plastic(!) container, to which we add 800 g of solid KOH. After the KOH has mostly dissolved we stir it well and let it cool down before use. But we don't work with polymers, so I'm not sure if your 70% *i*PrOH mixture is more appropriate. You could try to to make the 70% *i*PrOH solution and adding KOH analogously to our procedure and see if it still separates.	Thanks!

No you don’t need clarification. There is ZERO reason why you need to know why someone sold their own personal, private stash of tokens that they had earned. It is just as much life changing money at $6 as it is a $20.

These questions would be better-suited for an earth ship community. I would also start with an existing, proven design as a reference point. &gt;I'm thinking maybe South Carolina or Florida? That's hot and humid. I would first look into rural PA. &gt;What is a good, possible Earthen, material for the roof to support solar panels? Don't be afraid to just use a metal roof. &gt;would it be unsafe/illegal to use torches instead of electrical lights in the house? Just use LED lights. 	Appreciate the advising, thank you!

Girl, you need therapy/counseling STAT.	I know but no money
I haven't seen the stream since I want to go in fresh and new, but basically my biggest concern would be the story falling flat. Paper thin characters, bad storytelling, not living to it's potential.  The combat whether good or bad would not really matter to me at least, as long as the story is well done. I am kinda nervous since we are  only two days away from release. I really hope the reviews are great when it comes out on Friday, one can only hope at this point. 	The story won’t flop I promise you

Pretty average honestly, easy to stomp when you are playing with friends a lower rank than you. I don’t think she is as bad as people say. I never feel like I am at a huge disadvantage when I play verse people in my elo. I play other champs so when its a really bad match up its not a problem but for a one trick I can imagine it might be rough.	What about the Draven matchup? 
Too bad you missed out as it was just $35 about a week and a half ago. Don't buy your batteries there either, go to the sidebar and go to the places that Mooch recommends. 	curious why eciggity is a great company.

That bridge is called a “top loader”.  Depending on the style you have, there may be a better replacement bridge out there for you.  If you search for for a Telecaster Top Loader on Reverb.com you should be able to find some. One thing to watch out for is measurements though.  Not all Fender bridges are the same size and shape.  They frequently measure the spacing of the saddles and mounting holes as the reference point for the bridge so make sure any replacement part you purchase will fit your guitar first.  	Thank you!!!

It’s a concerto or concerto grosso from the Baroque era. Because of this the composer must be: Bach, Handel, Vivaldi or Purcell. I doubt it was Purcell though.

Duke isn’t cheap, but it’s manageable. I worked two jobs and was a resident advisor on East Campus sophomore through senior year. Not glamorous at all, and my grades suffered a bit from having to work so much. In the end it was worth it. You should also check out the Army and Navy ROTC programs. ROTC is a great path to come out of college debt free, start a career, and be an attractive candidate for future employment. 	Air Force ROTC is also at duke

From what I've noticed there's four types of male gamers. 1) The one you are talking about, throws out terms like 'bro' waaaay to often and is still shocked that girls play video games. These people are the worst and immature beyond belief. 2) Guys that are overly excited to play with girls because they think it's 'hot'. This is your hit or miss category depending on how mature the person is. 3) The guy that doesn't care who they play with in regards to gender. These people could be there just for fun or they're super competitive. Again this can go either way. 	You listed three

A teacher can absolutely make or break a class. My guess is that any politics or gender related jokes are the ones that get mixed reactions, but neutral jokes involving just the topic tend to be great for both making the lecture more fun. And It helps some aspects of the topic stand out in the class' memory. It doesn't work with just a few obligatory jokes mixed with droning I'd imagine, making the lecture fun in general makes a huge difference.	Games jokes

**Sren-Hyuu** (Resting Wave) One of the most popular inns/taverns in Nayar-doma, an enormous building about 4 stories tall. The first floor is entirely carved stone, with a built in bathhouse around the back. As Nayar-doma is a coastal fisherman's city, of Ogres at that, most of what they serve is comprised of fish and other marine creatures. Their most popular, and most expensive dish is Kirnau (cure-nah-hoo) stew, made from Red-Finned Kirnau, their equivalent to sharks. It's run by a grouchy old Ogre woman named Issra-ko. Hope you have the jade pieces to pay her--her prices are high and she doesn't take kindly to folks coming in broke.	What are the inn rooms like?

What was that story of a imperial nobleman trying to find a antidote for his love in a Tomb King city? His guide tried to loot the city but he didn't but was caught together nevertheless.

That's brilliant ha ha good luck with this undertaking, i've always wondered how playing real life Gwent with the same in game rules as inWitcher 3 would play out (i'm aware there's an actual card game but I haven't looked into it and don't think it matches 100% with the in game). I have a feeling you'd need to limit the cards per deck to stop people stacking spies or other obnoxious cards, and having to keep track of all the figures as you play. 	I have a method against spies. Brutal force :)

I'd need to see a full list of free agents but I think a couple of bullpen arms (including a lefty) and one or two veteran middle of the rotation starters would be a good starting point.

I was a MAT21 series (and 12, 16, and 17) tutor for 3 years. I think I got an email about becoming a tutor because my grades were high enough in all of the classes, and then I filled out an application and got interviewed (which included a teaching demonstration) and hired. They definitely prefer you having completed the series, but I only did MAT21B and C at Davis. Skipped A and didn’t need D. You need at least a B+ in any class you want to tutor. I didn’t have an “in” or even know any other tutors before I got the job. The first quarter I didn’t get that many hours but it picked up a lot after that. Overall, it was an amazing job in terms of the pay, flexibility, and people. Highly recommend!	How much is the pay an hour?

I just wowed three time. Literally. Thanks for sharing. Something I would love to have for myself.	Thank you! I'm quite please with the final outcome. 
In my opinion, I’ve always thought a dice roll was better for the fact that it represents a table-top RPG, and it makes more sense that even though you are better at that particular skill, it doesnt mean its a free ticket to always passing speech checks	Fallout isn't a tabeltop RPG though. 
You could have a partially clogged pilot jet (if the bike is carbureted).  It wouldn’t run well until the main jet became active; at what RPM that is depends on the bike. For me it’s around 3k. 	That's a function of throttle opening, not RPM.

Would highly advise anyone to avoid paying anywhere near that price for this game. The "game" is about an hour long with no replayability whatsoever. I say "game" because it's more like an audio book you walk around listening to. I got it for free on ps+ one month and even that felt like a small ripoff. $47 USD (after shipping) plus the possibility of duty fees is insane. 	WALKING SIM 35$
You look fantastic. Beautiful body, beautiful photo	Thank you so much

I believe he’s made the most of his car. Couple wins, several podiums, and good qualifying pace. He’s getting better with the reckless crashes and has shown growth as solid competitor. With Ric gone he’ll have the confidence as the #1 in RB but I feel the Honda PU will be a weakness and will cause a lot of frustration-which is still his weakness. He’s got a short temper. He’ll harness that with age and maturity.	This seems to sum it up nicely.

You see chap, experienced wrestlers study in advance their opponent's capacity to inflict damage. And as such, they spend days, weeks, months training their mind and bodies to either EVADE the finisher, COUNTER the finisher, or if all goes against their favor, TAKE the finisher with receiving the least damage possible. Hence, the surprising amount of false finishes in today's generation of matches.	Thanks Regal
A very good beginning, congratulations and keep it up	thanks mate.
Kitty!!!!! I want to hold it. And kiss it. And squeeeeeze it into a million pieces!! 	You are now my best friend

Awesome job i look forward to reading more of your writing. 	Thanks man let me know what i should do next. 
Not really a response to your post, but I love how when TBMs talk about church membership numbers, they always talk up the 16 million members, but whenever someone brings up the number of people leaving, they always say, well they weren't even active anyways. Well, guess what, TBM? 2/3 of those you claim in your 16 million membership are inactive! You're not as significant as you think, and even then, you're only 0.1% of the world's population.	So true!
I’m about as over YouTube/podcasts as I am make up lines. There are people who make it seem easy, but it’s really not that easy. And almost none of these girls have the discipline to keep up with it. 	Ugh same

Thanks, I'm new to HUT and this is super helpful. I have a question about the Ray Ferraro/September collectables. I finished the first set and received a September card with (I think) an 'x10' on it. Could you explain what this means? Is this equal to 10 of the cards you get from daily packs/objectives?	You bet! This explains it better than I can:

The magic number never goes up. It’s the number of wins required to clinch. Losses do not move the number in the wrong direction. Because we’re trying to eliminate the Yankees and we’re playing the Yankees, a win tonight takes 2 off the magic number and results in us clinching. 	Gotcha makes sense. Thanks.

I've completed one of these the other day. I agree CloneZilla is good but I had a big issue with it going from a 500 GB HDD to a 250 GB SSD (only 60GB of data used on the HDD).

Good to see the 2nd bus network redesign starting. SI's express bus redesign got watered down somewhat, unfortunately.	How so?
That's a good thought. I too was thinking about posting stuff to this group without the fifthglyph but didn't know what to post. This Friday, I saw a film with a group of folks who I am fond of(I don't know what to do for 'fri3nds'). It was a Malayalam film 'Varaththan'.	try "pals" as a good synonym!
The story I heard is that Lee originally had designed connector clips that would let you lock two or more harps in a stack to combine different keys or tunings. The injection moulds were made with the holes for the clips, but the clips were never brought to market. 	Wow, that's a cool idea...  :)

I'd say go for it!

You will never regret it. Except for when you are broke and wet and someplace you don't recognize, and then the sun will come up and you will get a landmark on shore and suddenly you're glad again. That's the way it happens. 	alright! thanks for the input

Political Science majors and Political scientists can be two very different things. Political scientists teach in universities, conduct studies in think tanks, and write books. They generally go all the way to the PhD level. People who have degrees in Political Science constitute a bigger group: government workers, people who work for think tanks at all levels, people who work in NGOs and nonprofits, lobbyists, politicians, legislative aides, campaign workers, lawyers, and even more creative positions/paths. 	Could you explain what you meant by creative position/ paths?

On the bottom left hand side of the tender screen where it shows the remaining balance and what has been paid already, just click on the amount that was taken off the card and hit void. It’ll ask if you want to void the Starbucks and hit yes and it will return to the original amount that was due. Then scan for a reward. As long as the entire order wasn’t closed, it’s easy. If the entire order ended up being covered by the money on the card and it closes the order, that’s when you have to go back and void the entire order, then retype the whole order in again, and then scan for a reward first. 	Thank you so much!  The explanations really help! &amp;#x200B;
