It has to do with the various subsections of the spacetime continuum. You may have heard of the Q Continuum, the most powerful one; the inhabitants of that subsection are nearly omnipotent and so had no trouble swaying everyone into giving them first billing (they didn't influence the alphabet in such a way because the different continuums hadn't communicated with ours, much less been given English names, until much later). The W Continuum, while far more obscure, is the second most powerful, so got second; the E Continuum is third, and so forth.	Upvote for Q Continuum!
Wenger was just subbing Lacazette all this time to keep his &lt;90min ratio what a man.	You got that symbol turned around.

Have you tried Deadly Hunter VR?   It seems pretty limited in the scope of the game (*no bonus points here) and I've only gotten into a few levels so I can't speak to the depth of content, but it's free on the Oculus store so there's not much reason not to try it.  I found the ability to aim accurately using either hand pretty spot on That is to say, you can aim by moving the hand holding the bow or by moving the other hand holding the notched arrow.  I'd be very interested to hear thoughts on this from anyone with lots of real-world bow experience.   The controller tracking seems very responsive.  Even holding the bow sideways while leaning over trying to dodge spears was accurate and responsive.	I'll certainly give it a try. Thanks!

So what? Only one NFC Playoff Team made it into the playoffs this year. I've watched NFL long enough to know that things change fast. Cowboys were 13-3 last year and looking like they were coming up. Eagles are 13-3 now but every year, there's a ton of roster turnover and we won't be able to keep key players	What roster turnover are we going to have?

FUD is making a lot of people lose money or lose potential profit at the moment. If everyone who is planning to put a sell order due to FUD just stepped back from their computers/phones for 24 hours, the price would go to 100K satoshis in no time. Because there is still demand for this coin. Well we know that people won't do that and continue to sell lower than what this coin should worth (close to $27.5).	You’re exactly right

I have severe OSA and I'm on BiPAP.  I talked with my pulmonologist/sleep doc about going to auto or BiPAP auto.  He said there's no reason for it and that dialing in the proper BiPAP pressures is superior to any form of auto.  I also asked about the effect of changing position (like rolling over to your side versus on your back).  He said that it's best to have a high enough BiPAP numbers so that apneas are avoided regardless of position.	Interesting. Good to know. Thanks!

BILD4 is very easy. Took it with Lo but Mel's class isn't that different. The writing assignments are very time consuming and will annoy you (making you think it should be a 4 unit class instead of 2), but they're only 4 or 5 (i don't remember for sure) and are worth a good chunk of your grade so make sure not to miss a deadline.

Combat is heavily influenced both by your skill as a player and your character's skills. So you may want to open up your character sheet, go to statistics, export the character to a text file, and use a text editor to bump your proficiencies up to say 150 or so. That will give you a much better sense of how the game's combat goes, since now one of the two of you will know what they're doing.	No cheats on the first play through, come on...
Yes. When I went to University and wasn’t the smartest kid in the room anymore. 	I beliveve that's just your ego being greedy.
Well, here I am, anonymous, all right. With guys nobody really cares about. They come from the end of the line, most of them, small towns you never heard of... Two years' high school's about it. Maybe if they're lucky, a job waiting for them back in a Panera. But most of 'em got nothing. They're poor. They're the unwanted. Yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom. It's weird, isn't it? They're the bottom of the barrel, and they know it. Maybe that's why they call themselves peckas, 'cause a pecka can take it, can take anything. They're the best I've ever seen, Grandma. The heart and soul. 	Saturday going well?

Well...I barely get to play. My life between the time I pre-ordered my Rift and received it looks RADICALLY different to the point where VR gaming has not fit in at all. I stare at it with longing. Knowing it will be there when things slow a bit is a good thought- though all the multiplayer games I want to experience with people will be empty by the time I play them. The few times I do get in though- I LOVE it. Even if the novelty has worn off a bit. 	I feel you brother :(

I feel like thats a really safe pick in the first round. He's going to be a good player and an instant starter but a guard isn't going to make a dynamic change for your team.

Can you compare it to previous legit purchases you've made? Is the text description the same? Maybe wait a day or two to check with Support again? Maybe the system hasn't updated to reflect it.	Text purchase is exactly the same as previous purchases.

I think for a lot of people it would mean a very sharp lesson about headline pay vs. actual take home once you get into the 40% bracket, lol. For me it would mean I'd just jumped to the (bottom rung of...) the top promotion/job title in my career, so that would be nice.	£65k gross = £45,479.68 take-home
On a scale of Shane Carwin to Eddie Bravo I’d give that a Derrick Lewis. 	Is that like a joe louis?

You can probably find 2013 depth charts showing base sets still up for some of the bigger programs, but you'd have to go through and search for them individually.  It might be harder for smaller schools though. Your best bet for schools that don't still have depth charts or media guides online would be tracking who their DC was and find what defense they tend to run (which might not be 100% accurate).	I never thought of those 2 ideas. Thanks bro

Thank you so much for making me watch this! I cannot thank you enough. This movie is just so good! The stop motion , the background, the entire movie was just beautiful. And the ending song! While my guitar gently weeps! It had been ages since I last heard that song. I stopped listening to the old classics off late with my music taste changing a bit. But man Regina’s take on that song just made me miss everything. I got such a nostalgic moment that I just had to listen to the original again and then the new one on a loop! Thank you. Laika for once again making an amazing animated movie. Probably up there with some of my fav stuff! 	Glad my post got people watching!

Just want to confirm something about the Discover savings account before I go for the bonus. From what I've read, cumulative deposits are enough to hit the deposit requirement. So, am I right that I can deposit 7.5k, pull that 7.5k out, push that 7.5k back in, and so on and so on. $7.5k is the most I can float right now, so just want to make sure that I can just push and pull the exact same 7.5k to hit the minimum deposit requirement.

My brother and I went to Berlin in like 2001 or 2002? We went there to participate in the “Love Parade”. We are from northern Minnesota, and the culture there was the most eye opening of my life!

Yogi Berra won 10 World Series in his career. I don't know how to quantify his contribution to those, but that alone has to put him near the top of that conversation. Also, he played less than 20 seasons. So he won the World Series more often than he lost during his career.	That’s clutch

B is the wattage of the device, C is # of hours a day the device is on (like someone said, if using a thermostat it won’t be on constantly). D is kilowatt hours per day. So if you know how much electricity is in your area per kilowatt hour (usually tells you on your bill), you can multiply the price per day to figure out monthly cost. :)	Mmm math I can use thank u lol

I just want to add that if you do end up developing an app don’t sell it with a subscription that costs like $60USD a year. The last person who tried to do that basically had their app get ignored by the sub. I can’t even remember the name of the app lol. 	My goodness 60?! Yikes! Absolutely not. 
I'm stupider then I think 	Me too thanks 
Because the law makers don't want these parasites feeding off of the government coffers, so they have to have someone pay for the kid.  If they didn't the kid wouldn't have food/ shelter/ clothing.

Does he play a lot of fighting games, or even video games in general?

OP, there's a lot of persnickety copyright laws and agent preference involved in something like this, resulting in conflicting answers in the comments here.

I don't remember all the details, but there were no issues last year when I did play around with Anne Pro firmwares. Placed the KB in DFU mode, installed the Win 8.1 x64 driver and the tool just worked. You can try to place the KB in DFU mode and install the driver from Device Manager if the DFU device shows up. If it doesn't then the KB is defective, the steps in the FW guide weren't done properly or there's a bigger issue with your Windows install/USB ports.	You're right, I didn't press the reset button correctly. Thanks!

&gt; For the first, Samsung is now able to match Sony’s devices with up to 720p960 high-framerate recording. Other modes available are 1080p480 and 4K120.

Also, can I just say that I'm SUPER jealous of how /u/ThePrince_OfWhales looks in his merman leggings?! I wore my mermaid leggings all day and didn't look half that good! ;)	You flatter me

Some days I struggle to get out of bed. I am so tired in the morning, and the idea of facing the day's problems just makes me want to lay back down and shut my eyes. Then I remember that each day is another opportunity to do my part by contributing to the long term trends of secularization, atomization, and materialization that are destroying traditional social structures. I think about the glorious moment when we will finally bring about the spiritually aimless and soul-less bug person utopia that people like /u/Kassirer fear. Then I get up	I should try this

Hmm, not sure if this flair of mine would be considered a spoiler or not. What do you think?	That's acceptable by my standards.
Start with something that you type or mouse click more than necessary. Something that hurts your hands when you think about doing that task. Now that you have identified the problem, select a tool to to help automate it. Windows environment? Powershell would be a good choice. Linux? Go, python, etc would work just fine. Then write the code to so that you reduce the key clicks and mouse clicks to something more reasonable. This is usually how I come to doing automation. I find a task I really don't want to do by hand. Then write some scripts to do most of the heavy lifting. Maybe some formatting will be required, but that leagues better than clicking millions of times to do the same work. Laziness makes me more lazy as I automate the time intensive work away so I can be lazy.	Are people share their own tools? or what?

Great! The original series is easily one of my favorite documentaries ever. I love the calm pacing and classy, erudite demeanor of Kenneth Clark. Also, the series still looks great because of the high production values. Zero flashiness, but highly informative and as relaxing as taking a warm bath. A highlight in documentary history for sure, together with Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and Carl Sagan's Cosmos.	Currently working my way through Clark's series and loving it.

As an objectivist and somebody who works professionally as a chef, Gordon Ramsay is not an objectivist. But he is still one of my personal Heroes. That is because he measures people on the basis of Merit. If he sees potential in somebody he will exhaust every effort within himself in order to help them realize that potential. Even if that means that they become a chef that can compete with him, he doesn't care. He would love to compete with a worthy competitor. That being said, a lot of what he does is reality TV for ratings. He makes the decisions he has to based on that structure. Whether or not you think that is objectivist is up to you.	An objectivist wouldn't do things for reality tv ratings ?

So in 2016 the Eagles gave up 1.8, 3.77, 4.100, a 2017 1st and a 2018 2nd for #2 overall. It stands to reason then that in 2018 the Bills could do 1.12, 2.53, 3.96, a 2019 1st and a 2020 2nd for #2 overall. Brandon Beane and Dave Gettleman have a close relationship, and if Saquon Barkley goes #1, I could see this happening. Then the Colts trade with the Broncos or Jets who take Rosen, and Cleveland gets Mayfield at 4.	Don't you put that evil on me!

I'm sorry that the top comment invalidated your experience and didn't answer the question. I too have legs that soar ahead of my other muscle groups. Heavy squats alone give me huge legs, so in almost every program I run I drop all leg accessory work, only running squats and deads. I have never looked back, and my visible physique is balanced, and my symmetric strength symmetry score floats around 90 (proficient). Change workouts to match you and don't listen to just blindly running workouts as set up. That is counter to learning the unique needs for YOUR body.	What about calves?
How do you steer it when there’s only one track? 	You do like my ex-wife, Eileen. 
Now start for 90 days streak 	Of course ... Thanks

I'm assuming it's more like /r/ethtrader vs /r/ethereum ... both will be used, where one will be focused on price vs the other on the technology. Is that safe to say /u/vornth?	Right, that's pretty much what we're going for.
Price on fury that’s damaged?	I was thinking like 55
Please remember to flair your posts. I've done it for you this time.	Ah sorry about that!
## [Spotlight: Shorthanded Goal Leaders by Team in the NHL](https://i.imgur.com/Mzy7Nic.png) The Jets, who aren't in this graphic, are 13th in the NHL with 6. In addition, Austin Watson's 4th shorthanded goal places him in 2nd place in the NHL behind Florida's Aleksander Barkov (5). 6 players (Gibbons, Comeau, E. Kane, Draisaitl, Arvidsson and Trocheck) have 3 shorthanded goals this season. 	Am erect

Why is this getting downvoted? 	Probably because I posted it. Ha.
1. A month goes by with little to no communication from the developer 2. Crowd gets upset about lack of communication, starts posting theories about how he is planning his exit, etc. 3. Developer gives an update and/or makes revisions to the contract. 4. Holders get excited, start commenting “bullish,” etc. 5.  Repeat 	bullish

10 coins will get you 20k. Keeping in mind, good purps BOE's for certain classes can cost something between 10-20k gold. There are other options, but I can't be giving away too much as it will impede on my business. 	Impede on my business.. what? 
In a few years they will say the same about Surrey.	i think so too
Ryzen 1600X / Ryzen 1800X / Ryzen Threadripper Either of those 3 would sort you out!. ECC is important. That being said, been running a Standard Windows OS Serving DATA without ECC for 6 Years.. On Normal RAM.	&gt; Ryzen 1600X A 1600 is fine, too ;)

Wait, are you buying levered CEFs on margin?  Or just regular junk CEFs? I'd go all in CEFL full margin and ignore it till the debt collectors start calling. 	Well, some of those have leverage, so both.

You can use [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) for that. It requires a bit of scripting, but for a simple button replacement it shouldn't be very complicated. I have a similar thing here where I changed my right windows key functionality, so holding it functions as a modifier key that re-binds WSAD to arrow keys, along with some other stuff. I also rebound the multimedia keys that I never used to be browser-back, forward, and so on. AHK scripts are nifty in that you can later compile them to an executable file, which you can drop in your Startup folder to have it always come up on windows start. Hope this helps! Cheers	Thanks, ill look into it!

A normal 21 year old man would not even care a little bit about a 14 year old kid changing. Unless they're absolute weirdos, you can rest assured they aren't having any thoughts about you and probably will only be as awkward about it as you are. Don't worry about it, sports bras cover quite a bit anyway. Just don't bring it up and it'll be cool.	Thank you so much, that’s really reassuring

People are curious, heck I'm guilty of wanting to know what the name of Rockstar Foxy's parrot is. Yes, it's not important to solving the lore but it doesn't mean it's wrong to even question it or theorize about it. I do agree the debates about gender do get annoying but in the case of let's say Mangle and Funtime Foxy. Scott has referred to both with male and female pronouns so calling it either or should be OK, anyone that gets upset about it don't even bother with them.	Well said.

Once I get the piled-up studies out of my way, I need to find some people to play sci-fi pen&amp;paper RPGs in person.

Just go play DOS2 or something nerd

How is 33 “extremely old”? Or rather, how does that determine his production? We went with a 36-year-old TE, coming off a torn Achilles, last year who led the team in receptions and tied in receiving TDs. Lewis has only missed like 6 games in 3 years and scored 5 TDs last year. This ridiculous false choice of “sign old vets OR young studs” needs to stop. We can do both; it’s not like there are a ton of incredible TEs on our roster. And what happened to “rookie TEs take forever to develop”? We couldn’t get Ebron, so here’s a cheap alternative. 	All of the upvotes 
Hey man! I’m up for this, me and my buddy are 1024sr and 1400sr and are looking for people to play with! If you want to join us for a few games and see if it goes well, hit me up!! 	Sounds good man!

I would focus your efforts on job postings. I feel like the advice that unsolicited resumes show ambition is outdated and unrealistic for today's job market, except perhaps in very niche industries or smaller companies. I know people who have gotten *internships* that way at very small companies, but I've yet to see it pan out IRL for full-time, permanent jobs. At the large organization where I work, we would 100% ignore your resume. Even a resume from the most qualified, enthusiastic person in the world wouldn't magically give us the budget, workspace, or need to hire someone new. 	Exactly what I feared. So much for chasing dreams.. ;-)

Maybe something where once per long rest they can use that stat in a superhuman capacity, for STR being able to lift something that even if they rolled a nat 20 would be impossible. For CON being able to drop to zero hit points and keep fighting for 1d4 turns. For WIS have an oracle-like moment of clarity about a situation. Something beyond just being good at it, something that transcends the use of the stat itself. (At DM discretion so it’s not stupid powerful)	I like your ideas

Lol at you edit. You basically said, "people keep asking for the evidence i talked about but there is none. Stop repeating your request for evidence."  Ill make you a deal, you provide the evidence and we'll stop asking for it.	I have done. Repeatedly.

I used 5 10+1 tickets and nabbed and eiko and an ayaka, of course this is right after I dumped a ton of resources in to pulling cg Fina, which I got. Should I spend resources on eiko or ayaka? Does eiko have more summon damage than enhanced garnet? That's the only thing I could see using her for, but ayaka just seems redundant with a fully tricked out cg Fina. Stop is rare in pve and even if it were an issue I have mistair as well. Thoughts? I'm out of inventory space and have an insane amount of cactuar so I'd like to at least level one. 	Having more options is a good thing. Max them both.

63 was an awesome year, from a visual standpoint you look like a well balanced and mouth watering treat. However, to be sure I would have to uncork and smell a little, take a little sip and cover all my taste buds, hold in my mouth a bit and let it rest before swallowing. Finally, i would consume the entire thing in one sitting!	Actually 1964😁

Helping other departments is definitely reciprocated, and that's a huge benefit in quality of life, if not wages. If you want to learn, you should just approach the relevant départment or an ASM and let them know you're interested. It's a big help when one department can help relieve the strain on another, and it certainly helps keep customers happy.	Reciprocated...what is this?

Ketoade, for me, has simply become a way to maintain a baseline of various things that I tend to want in my diet anyway.  Looking back historically, it seems unlikely I was getting a lot of the nutrients and minerals my body would need.  I may vary the amounts, but I can't imagine I'd stop drinking it even if I stopped keto.  That said, my ketoade is fairly robust, for example, my latest recipe now adds lemon juice for vitamin C.  I also add psyllium husk powder for fiber.  Lots of people take an array of supplements or specific things seperately -- ketoade for me is just a means to mix all those things into something that I can: 1. Make in bulk. 2. Consume in more regular quantities / more steadily. 3. Consume in a way that tastes good and becomes generally habitual anyway.	Awesome. Mind sharing your recipe?

A choir is a general name for any vocal music ensemble, big or small, classical or modern, religious etc. Somebody could refine this but a glee club is a choir that specializes in fun, snappy songs and would be made up of people from a certain school or something.

I'd turn off the grid lines, since they're not really useful for measuring on a larger map (unless you're using them as an index of locations) Also, rivers start narrow and widen as tributaries join them; it's a little odd to see fat rivers up in the mountains where they'd just be streams at that point.

No vouchers necessary! Anyone who’s participated in any mutual aid knows that bureaucracy is not needed to distribute abundance. When I feel a sense of solidarity with my fellow worker, I know it is in all of our best interests to provide whatever they need in any quantity they need.

2 QB, 3 WR, 3 RB, 12 team.  Can keep 2 + a rookie if kept on roster all year. I'm gonna keep Deshaun Watson as my rookie keeper, but I need advice on the other two: Pick 2 between: * Deandre Hopkins * Odell Beckham * Cam Newton I'm thinking I would take OBJ and Nuk, since Cam has been inconsistent for awhile, but in a 2 QB league, he's a big plus to have.  QBs are in very short supply.	Obj and nuk

Not sure if this counts since he seemed to be a one time prof my first year but Dave Mckenney(who taught 1005/1405 last winter) is probably the best computer science prof i've had in my 2 years here.

I just picked up this combo and I'm finding the connection between the adapter and the lens to be VERY tight. So tight that when I connect the two together, I'm worried about breaking something. I also had to adjust the element on the adapter to get the sigma to focus at infinity at 18mm. easy enough to do, but needed to spin the glass clockwise about 4-5 complete rotations before focus would work. Pretty happy with it now, as long as I don't need to take the sigma off of it.	how do you do this?

I'll think it's good to add under Part II that Sealed Gears have only 1 Passive Magi slot while the "full" version has 2 Passive Magi slots that can be increased to 3. Just for more comprehensive info. Similarly you may wish to consider adding in that Gacha S gears, after LBing, will have an additional Passive Magi slot advantage over Sealed Gears, while you are on the topic of comparing LB S gears with Seal Gears. Just a suggestion. :)	Added, thanks for that note. :]

1. Petrino 2. Stoops 3. Sanford it's pretty obvious. I don't think Petrino is nearly the coach he was 10-15 years ago but that doesn't change the fact that he's better than Stoops.

Looks like chlorosis, usually happens when your soil PH is too high for plants to absorb the iron. PH tests are pretty cheap and common, snag one, test it, amend soil with iron sulfate.

I kind of wanted to see my hubby wrestle another man.  I am also ok if he were to be on the losing end of the contest.  Being able to watch him struggle, and see him realizing that he is losing while I am watching is my way of bringing him down a peg.

So we're never losing again right? 	Not if Sevy's pitching it.

It's not a done job yet. Has to be passed by our lower House of Parliament (the Dáil) next, then signed by the President (in fairness, that's a given). And no doubt someone will try to test it in court. But it's getting there!	And it’d be very unlikely to have any complications.

The size of the tabs doesn't have much to say though. It all depends on the drops that were dropped and how strong and big those were.

And when he says they're around 125\-150 I'm gonna guess that he is only  dripping them. 	I’ll ask him about that stuff

I have worked on many jeeps for myself and friends over the years, just picked this up and my friends all said to start filming what I do, as a lot of the time its the less popular Jeeps that intimidate people. I picked this 1986 Jeep Grand Wagoneer up locally with in 3 blocks of the house for cheap. Everything power works even the rear window and sun roof. Sadly it was not running well, exaust leaks, powersteering leaks, and Vacuum which is important on these. Fixed all the vacuums and adjusted the carb, got it running great. SO now I am talking the rest of the leaks. I Originally bought this to install a 700hp Hemi in, but the jeep was to good to decimate.	Thats awesome!  Looking forward to the updates.

They would have to book a lot more EDM artists which I don't agree with (a few more is fine).  It sort of defeats the purpose of blending genres and allowing people to see artists they may not have seen before.

This is a really good point.

Long story short, I've been trying to find a new dress shirt that fits well for quite some time. After reading about CT shirts being the best option for slim shirts I ordered a few of the super slim fit non iron shirts in size 15.5 Collar, 34 Sleeve. I'm 5'10", 175-180lbs and I'm just not super impressed by the fit. I love the fabric and the "feel" to the shirt, but it still feels like I'm trying to grow into my dad's shirt. I'm not sure what's wrong, but it feels as though there is too much body in the fabric. Should I try to get these tailored? Should I send them back and get something different? Please help! https://imgur.com/a/AIj4iBO 	You could try having it darted in the back.

I use a bunch of mods that add buildings to neighborhoods and aquaducts that unlock by having certain technologies and buildings built in other districts. I think civ vi benefits immensly from having a ton more choices like that. One of the things that happens normally is that you run out if new buildings to build a lot of the time, with more options it makes it so you're always have something new to build. Because if you have only one option you don't have to make a strategic decision, but when there are still 10 left, then you have to decide what is more important, which add depth. It also makes those districts worthwhile wheras otherwise they were underwhelming. TL;DR I support making each distict be desirable, and also just having more buildings in the game.	What mods are those?

I pretty much only discovery write. I have some basic idea of where the characters are going and how things are going to end, but the stuff that happens along the way is largely a mystery. When I “see” something shiny happening in the story, or get the inspiration for a certain scene, then I can write it, but otherwise I’m entirely in the dark. Diana Gabaldon describes this as trying to look at the scene from inside a trash bag. Sometimes the bag is clear and she just picks out the important things she sees/hears/smells/feel/etc and writes that, but sometimes the bag is thick and translucent where she can maybe only hear someone mumbling and tries to figure out what’s happening.	Wow, I don't like that metaphor at all, hahaha!

I dont like the shape of the hand. It is geometric in a non geometric piece of art. Inconsistent. It should be rounded with knuckles. The ring was very hard to see. And I wouldnt be able to tell LOTR is a referenece if there was no text to explain. Ive seen all movies and read the books a while ago and it didnt come to mind even though im a fan. And lastly the text is too fine. Hard to see and mismatches the aesthetic of big and bold like wario baggins. Make it bigger and bolder. Churozilla had huge nice text that matched the art. Other than that very nice beautiful work. All your work is enjoyable. 	thanks for your feedback and kind words!

&gt;Today, I have signed into law H.R. 3210, the “Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act of 2018” or the “SECRET Act of 2018” (the “Act”).  The Act **purports** to require various reports relating to the security clearance and background-investigation processes from executive branch officers, including the Director of the Office of Administration, within the Executive Office of the President. What a weird word to use &gt;pur·port verb 3rd person present: purports &gt;**appear or claim to be or do something, especially falsely**; profess.

I know this is a pinned suggestion in the Suggestions DISCORD. It would be an interesting addition to the game, with people being able to get a 'rotational' boost when taking off from bodies. I doubt there would be much 'gravitational' influence added, or it would probably get ignored entirely just to keep things simple for the game. Surprised no one has pointed out how Venus will have to rotate on its axis the other way to pretty much every other planet, although, you do all note Uranus, however I would have to say that it would rotate still in game, just incredibly slowly and in reverse due to the fact it is 98 degrees off, although this reverse would be incredibly slowly.

It doesn't let you get everywhere, but it helps you significantly.

That's essentially the whole point of Family Guy. Everyone knows that the jokes made on the show are satire and making fun of dark humour like that can be quite funny. Of course to show is always prefaced with the "This show may be offensive to some audience members, viewer discretion is advised" bit which works as a warning if you don't like that kind of stuff. 	thanks
A quick question: why would this be a reason not to ask for advice? According to the edits, I'd say the answers are aiming at solving your problem, instead of hackily circumventing it for a limited amount of time. Wouldn't that actually be better than the advice you were originally looking for? 	no

I like it. But I wouldn't go with that color scheme.  Seems too evocative of stoner/rasta themes.  The people who appreciate that are already in favor.  The people you're trying to convince are likely to be turned off.  	Swapping colors is an easy fix.

The job market in the US is red hot, I'd get right back in there but this time be ready for something like this as it can happen to anyone. You either want to be an employee or run a business.  Everyone that I know that wanted to run a business, didn't have any business skills.  They thought it was easy, just build a product and you'll be rich. BTW, you can do both, be an employee and hire someone to deliver your products to the clients.	I'm not in the US, but thanks for the advice. 
Modders can give you one until you restart the game. But it's only temporary and would be risking a ban.	Gosh dang it, thanks for the help.

Looks like a driver problem - Windows has chosen its own driver. As a way around this you could GPO install your print drivers across your estate with the old pnputil command.     pnputil /add-driver "C:\Temp\MyPrinterDriver\Winx64\filename.inf" /install That way, when the printer gets deployed, there's definitely no excuse for Windows not to choose the right driver (I'm going to be proved wrong, I just know it ;-)	This fixed it, thank you!

From the first time I ran in my pure\-flows I felt completely unable and unwilling to go back to wedge\-shaped trainers. The last time I tried was when I left my pureflows at work. The high\-drop trainers felt like running in clogs. I'm really surprised that high\-drop trainers are what most runners seem to prefer. That only really makes sense if most runners are intentionally landing flat\-footed or on their heels, which is something I only ever do when I'm completely exhausted. It seems that most products which are being sold as running shoes are training us to use our legs incorrectly and are probably a bit dangerous in the long term.	Agreed.

Let me try to add another layer for myself there. Once I dated a 5’4 guy. Another time I dated a 6’4 guy. Let’s see if this warrants me a ban.	Are you banned yet ? 
Oh. If you don't use polymorph or assasinate, you're opponent is going to be healed to full health at the start of your next turn 	plus deal a load of damage 
There's a post-credits scene with Bruce Campbell as Ash you know.	Post credit phrase 
This seems really fun. So save our ship simply transplants everything you surround in ship beams? Cool.	And hull
Ninja Defuse used to net more points, idk if thats still a thing tho. 	Still do
These kinds of posts really aren't helping either, it will more likely than not start (yet another of this week's) flamewar. What exactly do you expect to achieve, using this tone and vocabulary?   You also have a choice: let those pretentious posters be pretentious and move on, or let a mod deal with it. Find your inner Anna. As we all should.	And report them if you notice them.
Best keeper in the world lol oops	So overrated... 
There must be something wrong with my Wardcliff because I stood exactly where they did in the video and less than half of my rockets hit Val. In the video they literally all tunnel to him, They said that none of the Wardcliffs were masterworked so I don't know what I'm doing wrong...	Did you have empowering/Lunafaction?  That is a must.
I'm waiting for the Sonic response to this post. I am the eggman	No I’m the eggman

Wow you are such a cutie.	How old are you 
Hot Take: Elder Scrolls Six will be named "Hammerfell", but will also include the entirety of High Rock. Cold Take: If this is the case, there will be a mass REEEEing of alt-righters claiming that the choice too set the game in Tamriel's only black-majority province is virtue signalling.	Well the Stormcloaks in Skyrim were alt-right

Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Net 10, Page Plus, are all owned by Tracfone Wireless but they all have plans that will allow you to use Verizon’s prepaid tower system. To get access to the postpaid tower system, which includes friendly roaming at no additional cost, I use Selectel Wireless. 	Same towers just different priorities.
I think you should not put it on the store if you know that they are bugs to need to be fixed/not aligned. A beta is to get feedbacks about what you may missed, bugs you were not aware of, how they experienced the game etc, you shouldn't waste the "extremely" valuable ressource that are beta testers putting time trying your game if you don't clean up the game before presenting it to them.	Thank you kind sir. 
Very creative and disturbing at the same time. I love it. 	Thanks, I appreciate it.
The only people who use the term “90s baby” is someone who was born in 1999 and wants to be different from being born in 2000s	It does sound pretentious indeed

Relatives went there few weeks back. The parents are above 55 and while my cousin is 25. The organizer (mmt) had kept the first day open so that the people can adjust to the weather. My aunt got loose motions, uncle had a horrible headache. Mmt made sure that a doctor was always available and both of them were fine after taking the medicine. Cousin had no issues.

Hey, could you come online ingame?	Online
If you look at the diagram and notice that the vertical arrows are all bidirectional, especially the identity morphisms on A and C, then you can construct q using the inverse of id_A and the projection from the middle term of the bottom SES to A. Also I have two minor gripes with your post. First is that the definition of a split SES differs by the author. Some people actually take the existence of a left or right splitting homomorphism as the definition, and the existence of the SES isomorphism as a theorem. So it might be a good idea to specify your definition of a split SES. Second, your presentation of the sufficient direction is incomplete. To use the short five lemma you need to first show that the diagram is commutative.	...how do I show that a diagram is commutative?
Gee I sure do wonder why women won't go out with me, instead of improving myself in hopes to maybe get to know a girl and hopefully things go further I'm just gonna go online and post disgusting things about women and the horrible things I want done to them, that'll surely have women lining up for me? Yes? :D (sarcasm) 	That’s incel “logic” for you.

I feel like Ridley was a Meme as well, was dissapointed by the reveal... Geno, King K. Rool, nor Waluigi should be in Smash as characters.... we need other videogames to be represented!	K. Rool should definitely be playable though.

Just leave it alone, no need to abate it unless you have good reason.  If a test comes back positive and you do not remove it, you legally have to disclose that you know the house contains asbestos when you go to sell.  I'd only test if you plan to abate, but I'd only abate if you have a good reason to do so.	So are there any health concerns about the piss/feces?

Is the Surge Complete worth the $20?  I'm not a huge SoulsBourne fan, but I do really like Nioh.  Unfortunately I was about 30 minutes late to the party when it was free for a time :(	 I'd say it's closer to a Souls game than Nioh.

This is probably one of the best smaller subreddits I've come across. I've joined subreddits for other shows and the community on those subs are nowhere as fun as this one is. There's tons of memes, reposts, and overall extremely nonsensical and stupid stuff but that's what makes this sub so great. Nobody complains about reposts even though I see the same pic like a day after the original was posted. Ofc, who's to complain about seeing more 02?	You post 002 smile someone will like...

Most 2d indies are better on switch. However, owlboy is a bit unique. Of course, the game will be gorgeous no matter what. The graphical difference doesn't matter. In my opinion, owlboy controls better using a mouse and keyboard than a controller, but I'm sure it is fine on switch. It just depends on whether you want the portability or a slight improvement on the controls. I'd recommend the switch. The only reason I don't have it on switch is because I already owned it on steam. 	Great answer, I appreciate it!
These are Goals right here man. Great job! 	Thanks man!

People are mentioning FOV and bobbing, and rightly so. Another thing I've noticed is that the screen animations are kind of swimmy. Opening your inventory or crafting interface comes with a little animation now - and quickmove is animated too. I think I'm not a fan.	You can turn animations off. 
What position does Goretzka play in for his club?	CM, box to box.

I had 8 modules in the first year and ended up using two folders of 4 modules each. Each module had a plastic wallet of lecture notes, and a plastic wallet of questions / working.

You could try diatomaceous earth. Make sure you get food grade. Sprinkle on the dog (keep away from face), their bedding, carpeted areas, especially around baseboards. You don't want you or the dog to breathe it in, so wear a face mask and keep dog away until it all settles. 	Thanks! Will try.
kisses for you	She will return them with much love, and much stank.
yes, even nowadays. when an album goes platinum that means it's sold a million copies which is $10-$20 million depending on the average price of the album, and artists take a cut of 10% typically so that makes them millionaires. this is pretty rare though and the bulk of their money comes from tickets and merchandise.	What about with album equivalent units

Also, non-starchy vegetables come in at around 15g per cup (uncooked).	Good friendly beetus person

I'm an infant teacher too! Not many guys in early ed, especially in infant/toddler care, so that's awesome! I would just let the children lead the conversation... that way you're not overstepping, but you're giving them the information they need to respect you as a person. Correcting their pronoun usage is appropriate. Telling them you're trans and giving them this whole long explanation is probably not necessary, but if they ask questions just be as honest and as diplomatic as you can. Some of the phrases I've used (albeit with very curious preschoolers): "I feel like a man, what do you feel like?" "I would rather not talk about my body right now" "I used to look like a girl, but I really wasn't" "It makes me really happy when people call me \[blank\], what do you like to be called?"	Thanks that's helpful
It's hard to tell what belongs to the "strings" (synth) and what is some sort of oscillating drone thing behind them, but I just hear it as C#, A, B, F#, G#, all major chords.  It kinda sounds to me like there's a suspended tone (4th of each chord) that creeps in there, as though each one has the third sort of gradually bending up a semitone to the 4th.  Someone with better ears may correct me on any of this.  	Thanks for the insight! Appreciate it :)

But If I'm pick 8-10, I'm hoping Hopkins falls to me and then I can grab a Cook or Gordon at the beginning of the 2nd round. But that's just how my mocks have been going so far. It's all subject to change. 	AB

That is correct. It's used in another quest. One of the tombstones in the graveyard will give you a clue once you've gotten all 4 Dwarven Scrolls. Also, be light green wallpaper had the same ID number as the shard, so it can be used for the quest instead of the shard. 	Thanks! It's satisfying to finally know what that was referencing!

Windows resetting nVidia color settings on my computer has reached an all time high. It was originally only on occasion, now it will instantly default as soon as I close the nVidia color settings window. This is awful.. None of the "fixes" have worked.

Is that a Dillon?	No, this is a M134G from Garwood Industries.

Yes, like other insects. But it's not a heart in the same sense that you know. Insects don't have a circulatory system, instead their "blood" (hemolymph) flows freely throughout their bodies (this is called an open circulatory system, ours is closed). There is an organ composed of an aorta and and a heart of sorts that pulsates and facilitates the movement of hemolymph through the body.	&gt; Insects don't have an ***closed*** circulatory system.

I mean it’s your money. If you have to ask then you’re doubting it because you don’t like it that much. When in doubt... don’t	Well said never thought of it that way
Yes, I think it does. I admit I too have been worried about that but I think it's very unlikely given how the series was (and still is) presented. To me it has a pretty clear familial affair storyline going on.	Let's hope you're right.

If it will only cost $55m, then it's pretty much flop-proof. Unless it's inexplicably terrible (like, really, really terrible), there's no way this doesn't turn a profit. Though it is interesting they chose to release it just a month before Wonder Woman 1984.	Is this supposed to be rated R?

Everywhere LeBron has gone, the teams struggle in the regular season at the very beginning. Playoffs are a different matter but the OP's question said regular season next season so...Spurs. Lakers fans and Spurs fans will be biased about this. Really hard to come at it objectively but I believe in Pop's system and basically adding an All-Star and a serviceable big over a 47 win team in exchange for Danny Green, I think they'll be in at 52ish wins and a 4th seed. I expect the Lakers to struggle early on but put it together later in the season and get to 48ish wins and a 6th seed or so.  	48 wins might miss playoffs in the West this year.

Adding to the other upvoted answers, which are great, lagers and ales use different strains of yeast. Lager yeasts generally ferment (make alcohol) at the bottom, and ale yeasts generally ferment at the top. Ale yeasts were the most common for most of history, because they make a nice frothy protective coating at the top. The downside was that it was risky to do in summer temperatures because lactobacilli would outcompete the yeast and make the beer sour. In the 1400s some Bavarian brewers discovered/developed a new strain of yeast that could ferment at the bottom and could be brewed in cold caves during the summer. This new strain created the beers we consider lager. Of course with modern technology there have been a lot of advancements, and the distinction between top-fermenting and bottom-fermenting yeast strains is increasingly blurred. 	Great answer. Thank you so much!

I would go and just experience it with her and then talk to her about it afterwards and just be candid. ‘I enjoyed this part, but this part isn’t something I quite believe in, but I loved this part!’  Something along those lines.

What I like to do is use miniature horse.  Since each one is about 3 regular horses,  all you need to do is solve for  x= a*(x/3-430*45%¥6) x (1?790000x/0) Divide that by 6000, then multiply by 5999 and youll get how many horse to get to the sun. 	Definetly more than 12

1. The restaurant is private property, but open to the public.  You could have asked the customer to stop filming you, and asked your manager to eject them if they didn't stop. 2.

I suspect it probably traces back to command-line computer terminals, where a space would be interpreted as the end of the current word (whether that word is a command, a file-name, or some other bit of data being given to a program) So if you have a command for fetching web-pages like [wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget), `wget url` is how the command is issued. If the url contained spaces then typing `wget long url with spaces` would be ambiguous as to whether you want it to fetch `long url with spaces` as a single URL, or if `long`, `url`, `with`, and `spaces` are 4 separate URLs that you're requesting. Could get around it with something like `wget "long url with spaces"` but it's easier if the standard just says no URLs should contain any space characters.	%20 ?

Use the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dx2SMTLiberation/wiki/index) on the Dx2 subreddit.

Back when I was a teenager, I read a Forgotten Realms book called Pool of Radiance, which, to memory (going back over 20 years now) had a fair amount of zombies, ghouls and other D&amp;D undead.

I want some undead threat, with some creepy stuff. 	Action horror is where it's at for me, too.

It's possible to have all the traits of success, and still not be successful. Quick story: when I graduated from undergrad, I had an opportunity to join up with a friend on a startup. At the time, I was also offered an entry-level position at a big firm as a consultant. I chose the latter. Fast forward 15 years, now my friends are all millionaires and work in silicon valley, while I'm a middling white-collar federal employee. I don't ever regret that decision because I made the best choice with the information I had at the time. 	I agree, this does seem possible.

Mine would probably be: “Before you put my body in the cold ground, Take some time to warm it with your hand, Before it's coming to an end, yeah.” This one really hits me due to the fact it gets me thinking about my own passing.

Not true. Please allow me to speak in generalizations to paint a picture. A high school diploma had you working a trade or in the service industry 25 years ago, same as today. A liberal arts degree translated poorly to the business world back then, too. It's not as different as you're suggesting, and the unemployment rate was similar. eta: The biggest difference is that a 4-year degree at a public university wouldn't saddle you with crushing debt lasting into your 30s.	&gt;Lasting into your 30's That's it? Lucky!

I think the storytelling is mostly working, but you've got to get a better comics font! Comics Sans looks super amateurish -- especially when there are so many better comics fonts out there for free. I always recommend [blambot.com](http://www.blambot.com/) for good free fonts. You should also check out his ["better letterer"](http://www.blambot.com/articles_tips.shtml) series to get a better understanding of the crossbar "i" (when the letter "i" should have the horizontal lines at the top and bottom and when it shouldn't). Best of luck!	Thanks, I'll look into this.

I wish I could give you better news..though as a fellow Oahuan (sp?) I've also had pretty much zero luck.

FYI - No actual Negan footage	I'm still holding out hope that it's a joke.
I don't like the idea of enabling them to be afraid of banning players.  Its always fun to read about ban waves in popular games. . . because other games/companies do it.  Isn't it better to ban one waste of oxygen than to let that toxic player drive countless normal players to stop playing the game? I want them to drop the ban hammer.  	To be honest I want them to drop it too.
Don’t know but Dr Strange congradulated Tony and Pepper on their wedding.	Because they’re getting married

I don't think I'd get anything but a minimal tip reduction but you might not like your nose with less projection so...really make sure you're on the same page with the surgeon. You don't need anything else and honestly, I don't think you need a nose job to be attractive. Your nose is narrow, the tip has a contour, and it fits your face. You're also thin skinned so that makes surgery a little riskier. 	What do you mean im thin skinned?
Anytime someone ask who’s that, I almost always know. Who is this goddess?!	I wish I knew.

May  I suggest including "Chapter" markers in the video to break it up into relevant sections: park amenities, your gear, cooking, etc.  That way if someone us just interested in the park and not the cooking\* then they can find that easily. \*I enjoyed both segments.	Thanks for the advice &amp; watching
Welcome to week 6. The game has started! /u/guku36, you're home. /u/drgnlis, you're away, call **heads** or **tails** in the air. [](#datatag{"action":%20{"__enum__":%20"Action.COIN"},%20"thread":%20"970rnc"})	Tails sometimes fails?
Not a great attempt because it was way too long but it was interesting. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-j-H0_9R90&amp;t=27m14s	Yeah a bit too long, also a favorable bounce.
I was there a week before...  so close.	So close lol. I hope it was fun!

I'd rather watch Krystal than Annaliese	Why? Genuinely curious lol
I’m surprised I haven’t seen this mentioned but when the cheerleaders at the “Beaches” party we’re talking about not being a woman until you’ve had a child - made me think about the Camille/Amma mother/daughter relationship. 	It’s science!

We're being brainwashed by Etho!	Being? Haven’t we already 
Honestly, I kind of understand these ratings. Superstars run the league, and while we have the Pope, that's it. No one can really argue with Boston or Toronto. The 76ers are the only team that I would disagree with, but they have Embiid, Simmons, and last years #1 the overall pick who is scouted as a more athletic James Harden with a new and improved jump shot...they're a far more 'exciting' team simply because they have more personality and hype around their potential. That being said, Pacers in 5. All praise be to Dipo.	Praise be
Define R6 by Fractal Design	Oooo nice! Im loving the hatch
Whats your favorite meal ?	Bourbon.
He's the toughest of the 4 by far.  On Master Mode he's worse because of health regen.  I struggled with that fight a bit on my 2nd playthrough.	Definitely couldn’t deal with him regaining health lol 
Wonderful advice! And congratulations on finding a way that works for you.	Thank you

I would give it some time.  In other MMO's massive exploits like this will result in account getting banned, or at least the gains being removed.  Sometimes they even roll the servers back. I would 100% send a message to their support team and figure out if any action is going to take place.	Support team?

How big of an impact was the delay in retail sales in Ontario to SP? The only negative I guess are that older non-tech savs who never order anything online or kids (19+) who don’t want to order online and have their parents receive the packages. The drop today really was huge.	FUD

This is certainly a conversation the two of you should have. When my wife and I first moved in together, she moved into my apartment, and at the time I made a lot more than her. My apartment was more expensive but had a more convenient location. She bought most of the groceries and chipped in on utilities but I still paid the rent. It’s good that you feel like you should pay half, but if he’s in a position that you don’t need to and you have an agreement as a couple on what your contribution is then it’s perfectly acceptable for you to not pay half of his house payment. Relationships are all about honesty. Just tell him how you feel and have a conversation.	I think you’re right

Really nice storytelling. It's refreshing that you didn't just do a profile loop of a guy on a bike. Some of the bumps and jumps don't feel quite right(the shadow jumps off the ground plane) and I think u/Stinky_Fartface makes some great points about it not feeling fast. Overall great work!

Was in the park and this little guy landed on my hand and wouldnt let me set him down for a while, instead trying to realign himself with my hand and eventually settled on my finger. Not sure what he is but found near the Washington/Idaho border. He was just sitting there being cute and friendly, nudging my hand like he was trying to  get me to rub his head.	He’s so tiny and cute!
I believe Etherium just made an update to implement Feudal Despot Issue Currency Insurance.  FDIC Insurance for short.  It's where if Butterin likes you he can reverse these transactions and give you your money back, like what they did when the DAO got hacked or that famous wallet multisig screwup happened.	I thought they did not bailout the multisig wallet?

I do the same myself. Use discipline to not buy something then end up blowing just as much if not more on booze and whatever that leads me to. Maybe we should learn to treat ourselves with gifts when we refrain from drinking to reinforce good behaviour. Like treats for a mischevious (but totally awesome) pooch 🤣	Or a throne.

Great post! [This graph is what convinces me that 6 seeds is actually the perfect number](https://i.imgur.com/afPt3by.png). The way the season is set up, it makes sense to have all division winners make the playoffs. However, as the graph shows, the 4th seed is not as good as some other teams that didn't win their division; they're usually just as good as the 6th seed. Therefore, it makes sense to invite the 5th and 6th seeds as wildcards but leave the 7th seed out. I think the fewer teams there are, the better the playoffs are, and it also makes the regular season more meaningful.	This graph desperately needs some labeling.
I wouldn't be surprised if they keep tabs of everywhere people work on the problem. They probably need to know how much progress we have in puzzles, or just right now, the Liber Primus. Or, maybe they just think it's funny to watch us struggle. They're still human, after all.	That’s exactly what I was thinking.

Personally I'm not a fan of so much grey stone flooring. You should break it up with different textures. Use stone pathing on the narrow bits. Make the area around the pond friendlier.

The barns below are used to store kegs/jars

Most of the major technological innovations required the large-scale oversight of public conquest. Markets are really good at sharpening and refining and cheapening technology, but the huge, ambitious projects like the splitting of the atom, space exploration, the internet, et cetera - technologies that changed humanity to the extent of defining historical stages (such as the atomic age, the space age, the internet age, respectively) only really take place at the public level, due to the shortcomings of the profit motive. Capitalism might put a smartphone with GPS in your pocket, but it took socialism to get the satellite in space for it to talk to.	Where does the government get its money?

What books did you read before hand? Have you had a recent physical and blood work? Why did you start with attempting a 5 day fast? Did you drink water? Did you do anything that a reasonable person would do before randomly deciding to fast for 5 days? This subreddit is full of hundreds of people who have used various types of fastin (from intermittent to long term) without any issues. My doctor has been very impressed with the progress in my weight loss (85 pounds) and tremendous improvements in all my blood work including cholesterol, triglycerides, a1c and blood pressure. She has helped me decrease the dosage of most of my medications all over an 18 month period, seeing her and having blood work done every 3 months. I can only assume you are a troll.	It's a troll. ;)

This is called [Dynamic Currency Conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_currency_conversion) - you're always given the choice to opt out (thus the continue without conversion button).

Agreed, not a scam, just a very bad deal.

Am I the only one who is going to comment how expensive these cocktails must be to make? I mean for means of comparison, 1/4 of the comforter bubble bar is enough for me to make giant bubbles in my bath - and then I might use at the end of my bath some twilight shower gel or rose jam shower gel (for example). But yeah, I agree with you OP that a mix of all these scents (except if they're in the same family) would probably cause me a migraine. 	I totally agree - this stuff ain't cheap!

The Climbers - WH Auden &amp;#x200B; Fleeing the short-haired mad executives The sad and useless faces round my home, Upon the mountains of my fear I climb: Above the breakneck scorching rock, the caves, No col\*, no water; with excuse concocted, Soon on a lower alp I fall and pant, Cooling my face there in the faults that flaunt The life which they have stolen and perfected. Climbing with you was easy as a vow: We reached the top not hungry in the least, But it was eyes we looked at, not the view, Saw nothing but ourselves, left-handed, lost; Returned to shore, the rich interior still Unknown. Love gave the power, but took the will.	Lovely. I'll take a closer look at Auden's work.

It's worse than that. Even if you were in the same place twice, you could never prove it. We can't even say where something is without relating it to something else.

So I’ve seen a few different questions like this, but none phrased in the same way. In regards to the reset bug: On my Hunter I did all of the weekly stuff BEFORE the false reset. I just started on my Titan last night. If I do the weekly stuff on my titan tonight, BEFORE the reset tomorrow, I should be able to get the week stuff properly, correct? With that being the case, will there be another reset tomorrow for my Titan/Warlock? And will I be able to get the weekly rewards on my Hunter that I haven’t touched if I wait until tomorrow? 	Yes, you should be all good.

As a woman who used to be a terrible person, I can tell you that she is using you. She doesn't want to be "alone". If she really cared about you, she would be dating you. That's it.

I use Deadly Mist in both NG and NG+ for the all around good stats. In NG, with Cursed Mist you can build a dedicated Runic build that can melt Valkyries quickly, you can watch SMvR's channel for the Runic build. In NG+, I find Cursed Mist to be overkill for the Runic stat because of the soft stats cap (lower margin of benefit), and Deadly Mist+ got a healthy boost in Runic (68 increase from the original Deadly Mist). IMHO the NG+ one is even better than the NG one, and it works better in NG+ because the overall stats increase helps your biggest weakness Cooldown. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T12pwF73VZU) is my Deadly Mist build for NG+. Stats are at the end. Zeus build will always be the best damage build but I find Deadly Mist build to be pretty good too.	What are the soft stat caps?

Personally I would suggest sticking with mySQL and PHP development. &amp;#x200B; If you wanted to do back-end GUI stuff, you could actually create what is called a linked table and develop a sort of GUI in Access. There are a lot of options and Access is a good tool, but I personally don't feel Access is a good or even a possible back end for a web form. Someone here might know more than me about this sort of setup, but from my experience with Access this would be an absolute headache. 	Thanks for the honest reply!

Two lion stmr in.. And almost to my third 50% moogle with around 500k coins. Coooome on kitty! One more! 	Dam, how much luck do you have??
Hey! Funny enough, I have post in the works talking about this exact thing. The quick version is this: snipe cards in the auction house that are 75 coins/tp or less. These cards will always either A) go back up in price on Monday/Tuesday and be able to make you a profit or B) be a good deal on training points anyways, so if you can't flip, you can feel good about just quickselling for TP. Off the top of my head, I believe the thresholds for each OVR are as follows: 80 - 4k 81 - 7k 82 - 10k 83 - 15k 84 - 21k 85 - 28k 86 - 41k 87 - 58k The most consistent deals are in 83s &amp; 85s. 87s have been cheap this week too, but it can sometimes be tough to sink a bunch of your coins into such large investments.

According to data on this sub, the r^2 between the average of your AAMC FLs and your real score is about 0.8. It's hard to predict better than just the average of the AAMC exams, but that's hard data that should be helpful, and by in large the distribution of your real score should be centered around the average of your AAMCs. Remember that centered means it's as likely to be lower as higher. 	How many points is a r^2 value of 0.8?

I actually have a different experience than the others commenting about this. I called a school I wanted to hear back from, but instead of solely expressing my interest, I first asked them a question about how to make a update for something in my application, or a question about LORs (I can't remember what it was exactly, but it was a legit question). So I think if you follow up a legit question with your expressed interest for a top choice school, then it could help. 2-3 weeks after I did this, I received an II to the same school and am actually flying out there this weekend for it. So while I wouldn't just call like an immature kid begging for an interview, i think that from my experience, if you do it tactfully it could help.	Thank you! 
Is Medusa awakened?	She is, yes.
Rather wait for the Carhartt Air Force 1s	ooo, do you have a link about that?
I got caught in one of those survey traps when I was younger thinking they'd eventually end. I was wrong. Thankfully I a least entered false info.	Those surveys are endless time loops
Feeling Lementful is a blessing. Without that, repenting can feel pointless. I’ll be praying for you.	Thank you so much.
You can turn revengeance off whenever you want 	Or you used to be able to
military stuff or slipknot related 	Sorry, it's fulfilled but I'll probably do another one sometime!
are they doing the $5 burrito deal at this location?	$6
This should be addressed in 4.1 -- please report if it's still happening to you! [https://www.stateofdecay.com/2018/09/18/patch-4-1-is-live-now/](https://www.stateofdecay.com/2018/09/18/patch-4-1-is-live-now/)	Awesome, thanks for the heads up!

Such poor excuses for teammates you had, I do rather regret I wasn't there to present you with the most harsh encouragement you would enjoy. I do hope in the future your teammates wouldn't be so callously inoffensive and inert. Good little Mercys like yourself really do need to be gagged and leashed to an assertive protector who can narrate to them all the ways, big and small, that they need to improve as they charge headlong into danger. May you find such a person who fits your tastes next time.	Oh my goodness &lt;3 I sure hope so
Very, very beautiful sunrise.	Thank you! 
The taco shells fitting perfectly satisfies me greatly	Same! Lol
Funny quick hitter	my cool wine aunt loves this joke :D
only way i can think of doing this would be creating 2 SSIDs with same name and have the APs you want tagged (AP1 - Tag: Limited - SSID1: GuestWiFi - 2mbps) (AP2 - Tag: NoLimit - SSID2: GuestWiFi - unl.) &amp;#x200B; edit: nevermind. can't name 2 SSIDs the same on the same network	would have to create two separate networks to achieve
As the Commodores put it: "your once, twice, three times a lady."	🎶🎶care to slow dance?
Horrible and beautiful all at once. 	thank you. 
I've always assumed they're a splinter group from Irem given the two groups' longstanding ideological disagreement and relative lattitude. As for what they look like, I kinda just assume they're constantly wrapped up in fabric and cloth and look like an arctic take on monks. Lots of robes and cowls and whatnot.	OOOOH! I love it! A ancient Arabian colony eh??
Happy champagne birthday!! 🍾🥂 It is my birthday too! However I am now 27. Enjoy 18 while you can! 	Happy birthday to you as well!

Versions are handled a little weird on PS4, but the actual game should be updating to the newest patch that just came out 2.0.3	So you think the number is just a glitch?
The dark knight trilogy was good, though. I feel like it kinda kicked off the superhero genre. 	No Sam raimi Spiderman did
Webroot.	Same. Seems to work well for us.
It probably led to a lot of manipulation, but that manipulation is getting harder and harder to pull off. The price will find its way, all these forces at work in an open market is ok.	To be fair other noncrypto markets also have this "issue" 
They didn't even say that. Stop parroting it as an actual quote. It was simply implied that monetized multiplayer games are generally far more profitable than singleplayer games, which is true. An "ethical" single player game needs to be massively successful to match a moderately successful game with microtransactions in terms of revenue.	However multiplayer gaming is more saturated a market
How obnoxious.	Yeah...but I like them bouncy boobies though 
101 is stack overflow. Exploring GitHub issues isn't covered until 102.	What class covers reading the docs?

Panda 1: "AHHHHHHHHHE'LLKILLUSALL!!!!" Panda 2: "Dude, it's just Steve. CTFD man." 	No seriously that’s how I imagined it going. 😂😂

You and your daughter have the same beautiful eyes.  (Ok, I admit a bit of bias, they look the same color as mine) Pictures like this make TBM brains stop functioning.  How can they be even happier?  The neurons can't make that thought. 	Thank u :-)

Went to third class lats night. Is it normal to get exhausted/be slow during the warmups? My gym does warmups(front roll, back roll, shrimping, etc) down the mat twice. Since we line up according to belt rank, I'm last. So sometimes I'll be lapped or be the only one still going and everyone is waiting. 	Keep doing them. You'll get faster. Don't worry... nobody cares.

Captrail, I  love hitting that up early and having it to myself before the dog walkers with head phones over run it.

I will check it out. Thanks!

I miss the old days of quebec labor unrest, i remember in the 90s when drivers were called to go vote on a contract, they actually left their busses where they were and took cabs to go vote or the great grocery strick of 83 or 84, cant remember the exact year, where provigo AND steinbergs were hit by a strike. provigo went as far as boarding up their stores in some places, Steinbergs gave away all perishables to charity and they dug in for the long haul. Or when we could still have scabs, Steinbergs in the 70s one time staffed its stores with scabs and had armed pinkerton guards at all the stores!	/s ?

Next time you procure a vehicle you need to make sure you've either accounted for enough miles or set money aside every month to cover the overage. You can't negotiate the mileage charge - it's built into the lease agreement you signed. What you're going to have to do is get a buyout and have a dealer to appraise your car. If the negative equity is lower than the mileage penalty have them buy the car and roll the negative equity into your next deal.	Perfect. Thank you!

How are some (like on the right side) taking off in such straight lines away from the nucleus? It doesn’t look like there are roads there based on the rest of the traffic. Are they just driving in a straight line regardless of hazards??	I believe this is due to spotty GPS data.

I heard that one of the main issues with a land tax was that it would lead to double taxing some income streams, rather than encouraging productive use. For example, a landlord and someone with an empty house would have the same land tax to pay, but the landlord also has income tax on the rent. As such, there's no incentive for the empty house owner to start generating income because of the land tax and it leaves that particular loophole still in effect. I'm only an amateur in this stuff, so I wouldn't know how to go about arguing for or against that position. I was just wondering what people's thoughts were on it?	There’s other double taxation in NZ as it is.

You can bypass this feature by selecting all the photos, choosing copy, and then pasting them into the Messages Composer This feature is amazing tho and saves space on your device, the recipients device, and is instant instead of taking forever to upload/download. The photos are only viewable to whoever has a link (so whoever you sent it to would have to forward out that link, just like they would have to forward out the actual pictures so no change in privacy) for up to 30 days, and can be taken down at any point.	Ah okay, thanks so much for the insight into it!
